[Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1 (DPUB-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/) and [Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 (DPUB-AAM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam/) are now Candidate Recommendation Snapshots. That means we're seeking example implementations. These specifications help assistive technology users navigate through structural divisions in documents, for example, in ebooks. To learn more, see the [e-mail announcement](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/2024JanMar/0001.html). Please submit implementations and any comments by 27 April 2024.
