Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules help evaluation tools and methodologies produced accurate, consistent results. ACT Rules help test accessibility standards more reliably.

We encourage evaluation tools and methodologies to implement the individual ACT Rules and to share your implementation report on the W3C WAI website.
