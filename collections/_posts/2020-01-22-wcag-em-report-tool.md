The Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group ([EOWG][0001]) has published an updated version of [WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator][0002].

The tool helps you generate website accessibility evaluation reports according to [Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)][0003]. WCAG-EM is an informative W3C Working Group Note. It describes an approach for evaluating how websites, including web applications and websites for mobile devices, conform to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)][0004]. We welcome feedback on this version of the WCAG-EM Report Tool and suggestions for improvements for the next version.
