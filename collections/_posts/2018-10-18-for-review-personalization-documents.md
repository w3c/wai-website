The updated [Personalization Semantics Explainer](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/) Working Draft provides an introduction to personalizing the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of users, and to current work on specifications to support personalization. Personalization Working Drafts published today include: Personalization Semantics Content Module, Personalization Help and Support, and Personalization Tools. The Personalization Task Force is seeking advice on choosing an implementation mechanism; see the Issue under [Vocabulary Implementations](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/#vocabulary-implementations).
