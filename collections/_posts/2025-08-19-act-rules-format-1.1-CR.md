[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.1/) is now a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot. That means we’re seeking example implementations. ACT Rules Format defines a format for writing accessibility test rules that can be used for developing automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies. For an introduction to Accessibility Conformance Testing, see the [ACT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/). We welcome implementations any time. Please submit any comments by 20 October 2025.
