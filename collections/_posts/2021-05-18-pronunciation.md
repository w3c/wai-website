<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-spoken-html-20210518/">Specification for Spoken Presentation in HTML</a> Working Draft is ready for review. This document is part of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/">W3C work on pronunciation</a> to provide normative specifications and best practices guidance so that   text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis can properly pronounce HTML content. This Draft specification describes two possible   technical approaches for author-controlled pronunciation. W3C is    seeking more input on these approaches, particularly from content   authors and implementors. Please send comments by <strong>18 June 2021</strong>.</p>
