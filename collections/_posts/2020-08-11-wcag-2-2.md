<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2 Working Draft</a> is ready wide review before finalizing WCAG 2.2. This version has 9 new "success criteria"  (requirements) since WCAG 2.1. The new success criteria address user needs of people with cognitive or learning disabilities, users of mobile devices, and users of ebooks. We want to hear from users, authors, tool developers, policy makers, and others about benefits from the new proposed success criteria, as well as how achievable you feel it is to conform to the new success criteria. Additional information is in the blog post <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/08/wcag22-wide-review/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Draft for Review</a>. Please submit comments by 18 September 2020.
