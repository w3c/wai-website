<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam-1.0/">Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings (DPub-AAM) 1.0</a> has been published as a Candidate Recommendation and is now undergoing implementation finalization and testing. DPub-AAM describes how roles in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0</a> should be exposed to accessibility APIs. Implementation of this specification makes it possible for assistive technologies to provide enhanced navigation among landmarks unique to digitally-published documents, and to identify document-specific features which should be presented to the user, such as crossing a page boundary. These mappings will also be used in part for verifying implementation success of Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 which is already a Candidate Recommendation. The draft <a href="http://w3c.github.io/test-results/dpub-aam/all.html">implementation report</a> shows the progress of testing. Please send
