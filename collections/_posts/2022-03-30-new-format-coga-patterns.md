Cognitive accessibility objectives and design patterns are now available as a set of web pages from [Cognitive Accessibility Guidance list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/#cognitiveaccessibilityguidance). The objectives and design patterns are "supplemental guidance" to WCAG 2 as explained in [About Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/). They are part of W3C work on accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities introduced in [Cognitive Accessibility at W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/).
