<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics 1.0</a> has been published as a First Public Working Draft. Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the user. The introduction of standardized semantics allows web applications to customize the exposure of that content to one that is familiar to individuals based on their needs and preferences. This specification was initially developed in a task force to provide technology features needed to meet needs of users with cognitive or learning disabilities, but is intended to support a wide variety of personalization use cases. Please comment by filing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/issues/">GitHub issues in the personalization semantics repository</a> or, if this is not feasible, by email to <a href="mailto:public-aria@w3.org">public-aria@w3.org</a>, by <strong>30 June 2017</strong>.
