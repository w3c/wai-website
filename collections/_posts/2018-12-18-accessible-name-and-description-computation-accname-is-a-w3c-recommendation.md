[Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/) ("Accname") was published today as a "W3C Recommendation" web standard. It describes how browsers and other user agents determine the names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages. This information is in turn exposed through accessibility APIs so that assistive technologies can identify these objects and present their names or descriptions to users.
