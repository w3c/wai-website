[Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.1/) (DPUB-ARIA) and [Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam-1.1/) (DPUB-AAM) are now web standards (W3C Recommendations). DPUB-ARIA defines a set of ARIA roles to help assistive technology users navigate structural divisions of long-form digital documents, such as eBooks. DPUB-AAM defines how user agents (such as eBook readers) map the DPUB-ARIA markup to platform accessibility APIs. For an introduction to WAI-ARIA, see [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).
