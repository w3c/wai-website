[Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/) is available as a Draft Note. This document is a first draft update to the previous [WCAG2ICT Note that provided guidance on applying WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-20/) to non-web documents and software. This updated draft includes guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria and glossary terms. We will add guidance for WCAG 2.2 success criteria in upcoming drafts. For an introduction, see the [WCAG2ICT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/).
