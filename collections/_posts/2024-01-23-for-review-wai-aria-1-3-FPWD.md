[Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.3/) Working Draft is available for review. WAI-ARIA provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. These semantics allow authors to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies. Changes from ARIA 1.2 include: new roles (suggestion, comment, mark), new attributes (aria-description, aria-braillelabel, aria-brailleroledescription) and updates to aria-details to allow multiple IDREFS. Additional changes are in the [changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.3/#changelog). Please submit any comments by 21 February 2024. For an introduction to WAI-ARIA and related resources, see the [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).
