The W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG) is addressing open issues on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and 2.2. Most issue resolutions resulted in updates to [Understanding WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/) and [Techniques for WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/). Some resulted in minor editorial updates to the WCAG standard. Today W3C published updates to: [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). For a list of updates, see the Change Log section of each document. Please share this web page as the place to start for up-to-date information on WCAG 2: [WCAG 2 Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
