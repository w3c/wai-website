<p>The Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/">EOWG</a>) has published the <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/">ATAG Report Tool</a></strong>. Authoring tools are software and services used to create web content â€“ such as content management systems (CMS) and what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors. W3C's Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) addresses making the authoring tools themselves accessible and helping authors create more accessible web content. Learn more from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">ATAG Overview</a>. The new ATAG Report Tool helps authoring tool vendors and evaluators provide information to project managers, procurers, and others who need to know how well potential authoring tools support accessibility.</p>
