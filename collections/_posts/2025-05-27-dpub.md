[DPUB-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.1/) and [DPUB-AAM](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam-1.1/) are "W3C Recommendation" Web standards. DPUB-ARIA defines a set of ARIA roles to help users of assistive technologies navigate structural divisions of long-form documents, for example, those in eBooks and other digital publications. DPUB-AAM defines how user agents map the DPUB-ARIA markup to platform accessibility APIs. For an introduction, see: [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).
