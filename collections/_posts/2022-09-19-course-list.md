[Course List - Digital Accessibility Education, Training, and Certification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/list/) includes publicly-available courses around the world. We expect to add more courses in the coming weeks. We invite course providers to submit your courses. We may also revise the user interface based on additional user feedback. Please send any comments by 17 October 2022.
