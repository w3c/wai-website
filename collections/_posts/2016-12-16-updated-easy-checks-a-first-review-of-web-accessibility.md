<p>WAI's Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) has updated <a href="{{ "/test-evaluate/preliminary/" | relative_url }} ">Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility</a>. This resource helps you start to assess the accessibility of a web page. With these simple steps, you can get an idea whether or not accessibility is addressed in even the most basic way. These checks cover just a few accessibility issues and are designed to be quick and easy, rather than definitive. This update includes a new check on <a href="{{ "/test-evaluate/preliminary/" | relative_url }}#moving">Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content</a> and instructions for the Web Developer Toolbar for multiple browsers.</p>
