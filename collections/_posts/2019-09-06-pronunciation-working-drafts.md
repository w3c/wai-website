The new [Pronunciation Overview page](/pronunciation/) provides an introduction to WAI's work on ways for screen readers to accurately pronounce content. It introduces three First Public Working Drafts for review: [Pronunciation User Scenarios](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-user-scenarios/), [Pronunciation Use Cases](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-use-cases/), [Pronunciation Gap Analysis](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-gap-analysis/). We welcome your comments on these drafts, preferably by 14 October 2019.
