[W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) is published for review. W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 has several differences from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.

We encourage you to **start by reading the [WCAG 3 Introduction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag3) first** to get important background on WCAG 3 development, review guidance, and timeline.

WCAG 3 is intended to be easier to understand and more flexible than WCAG 2. The flexibility is to address different types of web content, apps, and tools &mdash; as well as organizations and people with disabilities. This WCAG 3 Draft proposes a different name, scope, structure, and draft conformance model.

We are seeking input from evaluators, developers, designers, project managers, policy makers, people with disabilities, and others â€” particularly on the structure and the draft conformance model. Additional review guidance is in the blog post [WCAG 3 FPWD Published](https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/01/wcag-3-fpwd/). Please submit comments **by 26 February 2021**.
