[How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/) is updated with new user stories (personas) and videos highlighting "Accessibility: It's about people". It describes tools and approaches that people use to interact with the web and the barriers they encounter due to poor design. This multi-page resource helps developers, designers, and others understand the "why" in creating accessible websites, apps, browsers, and other web tools. To quote the new videos: Whatever your role, "You can help make technology accessible to me."
