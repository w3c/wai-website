W3C expects to publish Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22) as a "W3C Recommendation" web standard in 2023. We are addressing new comments that we received in August 2023. Depending how that goes, the final publication could be in September or later in 2023.
