<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/naur">Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements</a>("NAUR")Working Draft is available for review and comment. This document outlines accessibility user needs, requirements, and scenarios for natural language interfaces. A natural language interface is a user interface in which the user and the system communicate via a natural (human) language. The user provides input as sentences via speech or other input, and the system generates responses as sentences delivered by speech, text, or another modality.
