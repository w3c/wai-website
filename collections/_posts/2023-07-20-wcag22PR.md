[WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22) is now a W3C 'Proposed Recommendation'. Proposed Recommendation means that W3C accepted it and W3C Members vote on publishing the document as a 'W3C Recommendation' web standard. The voting ends on 19 August. WCAG 2.2 might be ready to publish soon after that, or additional W3C Member input could require more work. To learn more and get up-to-date information, see [What's New in WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).
