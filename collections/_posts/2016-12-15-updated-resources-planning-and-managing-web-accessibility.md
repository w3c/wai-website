It provides guidance on addressing short-term accessibility fixes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/">Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility</a> helps you develop  a simple or comprehensive web accessibility policy for an organization.</li>
<li><a href="{{ "/planning-and-managing/" | relative_url }}">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a> helps you integrate accessibility throughout the web production process. It applies to individual projects and at the organizational level.</li>
