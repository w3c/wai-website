<p>The Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/">EOWG</a>) has published <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/">5 short videos that introduce evaluation resources</a> from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI</a>). The animated videos cover: Easy Checks — A First Review of Web Accessibility,  Evaluation Tools, Conformance Evaluation including the Report Tool, and Involving Users in Web Accessibility. Other WAI videos include: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/">Video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives videos</a> that demonstrate how accessibility is essential for some and useful for all. These videos are particularly useful to share for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (<a href="https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/">GAAD</a>) on 21 May 2020 — along with the free online course: <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/12/free-online-course-introduction-to-web-accessibility/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>.</p>
