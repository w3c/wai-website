Translations are now easier to get to on the W3C WAI website. The "All Translations" link near the top of all WAI web pages goes to: [All WAI Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/). More information about translations is in the [28 March e-mail](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/2019JanMar/0006.html).
