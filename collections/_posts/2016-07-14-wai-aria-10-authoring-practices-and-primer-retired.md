<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</a> is the key support resource from the ARIA Working Group for content authors using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA). The older draft WAI-ARIA 1.0 support resources have been retired: Authoring Practices and Primer. The content of those older documents in this publication has been removed and the Status section directs readers to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</a>. Content that is still relevant from the older resources has been migrated to and updated in the WAI-ARIA 1.1 Authoring Practices.
