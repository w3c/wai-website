The redesigned [W3C WAI website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) makes it easier to get information to help you improve web accessibility. The visual design, information architecture, navigation, and overall user experience is all new. Much of the content is revised, and we plan to revise more in the coming months. The redesign makes it easier to skim pages, read content, find specific information, and discover new resources. It's also easier for the community to be involved in improving resources. Please see [W3C WAI Website Redesign Information](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/wiki/W3C-WAI-Website-Redesign-Information) for:
* Planned Changes and Known Issues
