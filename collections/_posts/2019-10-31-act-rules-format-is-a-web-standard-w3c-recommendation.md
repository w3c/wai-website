[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) was published today as a “W3C Recommendation” web standard. This standard helps developers of automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies to write, share, and implement test rules. The rules contribute to consistent testing for accessibility standards compliance. ACT is introduced in the [ACT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/). For more information and examples of organizations already using ACT, see the blog post: [Calibrate Your Accessibility Evaluation With ACT](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/10/calibrate-your-accessibility-evaluation-with-act).
