title: "For Review: RTC Accessibility User Requirements (RAUR) First Draft"
date: 2020-03-19
---

The First Public Working Draft of the Working Group Note [RTC Accessibility User Requirements (RAUR)](https://www.w3.org/TR/RAUR/) is now available for review. RAUR outlines user needs, requirements, and scenarios for real-time communication (RTC) to be accessible to people with disabilities. Accessible telecommunication technology is increasingly important for people who are working remotely and relying on RTC for daily needs. The purpose of this document is to inform the development of specifications and underlying architecture at W3C and beyond. Some of the requirements apply at the system or platform level, and some are authoring requirements. We would particularly like input on any user needs or requirements that are missing from this draft. For more information, see the blog post [RTC Accessibility User Requirements â€“ Call for Review](https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/03/rtc-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/).
