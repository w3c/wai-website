title: "For Review: ACT Rules Format 1.0 Working Draft"
date: 2018-03-03
---

An updated Working Draft of [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/) is available for review. This draft addresses all comments received on the previous draft. Most importantly, the "Selector" approach was replaced with "Applicability" and "Expectation" pairs, to make ACT Rules less procedural. This draft is accompanied by [sample ACT Rules](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act-rules/) that implement this rules format. Please submit any comments, especially comments related to implementation experience, as soon as possible, before **5 April 2018**.
