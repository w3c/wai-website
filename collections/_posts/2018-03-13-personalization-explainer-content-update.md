The ARIA WG has published an updated draft of [Personalization Semantics Explainer 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/) and [Personalization Semantics Content Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-content-1.0/). The explainer adds a Vocabulary Identification section, does some changes in sections of WAI-ARIA and HTML Microdata, also replaces the RDFa section with editor's note. The Content module removes aui prefixes from property names, changes some examples and adds some editor's note in the document. Please comment by **13 April 2018**.
