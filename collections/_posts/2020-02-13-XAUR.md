title: "For Review: XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR) First Draft"
date: 2020-02-13
---

The First Public Working Draft of the Working Group Note [XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/) is now available for review. The XAUR document describes the needs of people with disabilities in virtual or immersive environments (XR). It includes requirements for XR to be accessible. XAUR is for designers and developers who are involved in creating XR experiences. It is also useful for anyone who wants to better understand XR accessibility. We would particularly like input on any user needs or requirements that are missing from this draft. For more information, see the blog post [XR Accessibility User Requirements â€“ call for review](https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/03/xr-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/).
