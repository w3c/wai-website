[Cognitive Accessibility Research Modules](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-research-modules/) are available as first Draft Notes. The documents cover research on accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities for [Voice Systems and Conversational Interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-voice/), [Technology Assisted Indoor Navigation / Wayfinding](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-wayfinding/), [Online Safety and Wellbeing (Algorithms and Data)](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-safety/), and [Supported Decision-Making Online](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-sdm/). They address user needs, accessibility issues, directions for solutions, and areas for further research. We particularly seek input on what might be appropriate to add to these documents, including other relevant research, additional user needs, and the connection between research and priorities for new work in W3C groups. Information on related work is in [Cognitive Accessibility at W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/).
