<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group</a> has published Proposed Recommendations of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-wai-aria-1.1-20171102/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-core-aam-1.1-20171102/">Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-dpub-aria-1.0-20171102/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-dpub-aam-1.0-20171102/">Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings</a>. WAI-ARIA recommends approaches for developers to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible to people with disabilities. WAI-ARIA 1.1 adds features new since WAI-ARIA 1.0 to complete the HTML + ARIA accessibility model and supports additional modules for digital publishing and graphics. DPub-ARIA defines a WAI-ARIA module encompassing an ontology of roles, states and properties specific to the digital publishing industry. This allows an author to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies and to enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers. User agent implementation to date is shown in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA implementation report</a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/core-aam/">Core-AAM implementation report</a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/dpub-aria/">DPub-ARIA implementation report</a>, and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/dpub-aam/">DPub-AAM implementation report</a>.
