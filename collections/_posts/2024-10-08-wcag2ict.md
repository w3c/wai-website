[Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/) is a completed W3C Group Note. WCAG2ICT describes how Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) principles, guidelines, and success criteria can be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), specifically to non-web documents and software. The document includes guidance for WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 success criteria and glossary terms. WCAG2ICT has been a key resource for including WCAG in ICT accessibility regulation, legislation, and standards around the world. This update facilitates further adoption of WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 in non-web contexts. For an introduction, see: [WCAG2ICT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/).
