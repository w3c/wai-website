title: "For Review: XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR) Updated Draft"
date: 2020-09-16

An updated Working Draft of [XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/) is now available for review. XAUR describes the needs of people with disabilities in virtual or immersive environments (XR). It includes requirements for XR to be accessible. XAUR is for designers and developers who are involved in creating XR experiences. It is also useful for anyone who wants to better understand XR accessibility. We would particularly like input on any user needs or requirements that are missing from this draft. For more information, see the [XAUR review e-mail](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/2020OctDec/0000.html).
