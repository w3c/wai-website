title: "For Review: Pronunciation of Text-To-Speech (TTS) Working Drafts"
date: 2020-03-10
---

New drafts of Working Group Notes are available for review: [Explainer: Improving Spoken Presentation on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-explainer/) and [Pronunciation Gap Analysis and Use Cases](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-gap-analysis-and-use-cases/). These documents will guide work on a normative specification to enable content authors to ensure that text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis properly pronounces HTML content. We would particularly like input on additional use cases and requirements not described in these documents; and any aspects of the analysis that are missing, incorrect, or insufficiently defined. For context of this work, please see the [Pronunciation Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/).
