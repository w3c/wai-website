[WAI-ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) is now a “W3C Recommendation” web standard. WAI-ARIA provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. These semantics allow authors to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies. A list of what's changed since WAI-ARIA 1.1 is in the [changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#changelog).
