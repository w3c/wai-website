<p>We're excited about the shiny new version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">How to Meet WCAG 2.0: A customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 requirements (success criteria) and techniques</a>. It has a more modern design and additional functionality to filter by Tags that are categorized under Developing, Interaction Design, Content Creation, and Visual Design. (The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/20160317/">previous version</a> is still available.)</p>
