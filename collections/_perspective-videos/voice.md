Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. Learn about the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations.

Update: The video uses "voice recognition". This page is updated to use "speech recognition". "Speech recognition" is about recognizing words for speech-to-text (STT) transcription, virtual assistants, and other speech user interfaces. "Voice recognition" or "speaker recognition" is technology that identifies who the speaker is, not the words they're saying. We hope to update the video to use "speech recognition" in late 2022.

What is "Speech Recognition"? {#what}
----------------------------

Speech recognition can be used for dictating text in a form field, as well as navigating to and activating links, buttons, and other controls. Most computers and mobile devices today have built-in speech recognition functionality. Some speech recognition tools allow complete control over computer interaction, allowing users to scroll the screen, copy and paste text, activate menus, and perform other functions.

Who depends on this feature? {#who}
----------------------------

-   People with physical disabilities who cannot use the keyboard or mouse.
-   People with chronic conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries (RSI), who need to limit or avoid using the keyboard or mouse.
-   People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need to use speech rather than to type.

What are the additional benefits? {#others}
---------------------------------

-   Content works for people with temporary limitations, such as a broken arm.
-   Content is more usable for people who prefer to speak rather than type, for example, while multi-tasking.

What needs to happen for this to work? {#action}
--------------------------------------

Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can be controlled by speech. [keyboard compatibility](/perspective-videos/keyboard/) is the basis for such coding. In addition, labels and identifiers for controls in the source code need to match their visual presentation, so that it is clear which speech command will activate a control.
