## What is "Colors with Good Contrast"?
{:#what}

Colors must have sufficient contrast, for example, between the text color and the background color (technically called <em>luminance contrast ratio</em>). This includes text on images, icons, and buttons. Also colors used to convey information on interactive elements, diagrams, maps, and other types of content must be distinguishable.

## Who depends on this feature?
{:#who}

-   People with low contrast sensitivity, which is common in older people.
-   People who cannot distinguish between certain colors (often called “color blindness”).

## What are the additional benefits?
{:#others}

-   Content works in different lighting conditions, such as sunlight and glare.
-   Content is easier to read by everyone, including those who do not have specific visual conditions.

## What needs to happen for this to work?
{:#action}

Select colors that provide sufficient contrast. There are tools to help check and select appropriate color combinations. This is ideally done during the early design stage and the selection of color palettes. While some people need high contrast, some people are sensitive to brightness and need to [change the colors](/perspective-videos/customizable/).
