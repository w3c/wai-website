Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. Learn about the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations.

The 10 short videos [linked below](#pages) illustrate how accessibility is essential for some and useful for all. This page provides a "compilation", that is, **one longer video that includes all the 10 short videos**. It is less than 8 minutes long, and is useful for presentations and [translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/).
