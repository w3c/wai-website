This page provides a starting point for information that is particularly relevant to people with disabilities, older web users, and advocates.

## Summary

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual.

Web developers and designers can create web sites and web applications that are accessible, or that are inaccessible.

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. They are considered international standards for web accessibility; for example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 is also an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard: ISO/IEC 40500.
