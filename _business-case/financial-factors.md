## Introduction
{:#intro}


This page is part of a resource suite that describes the
[**social**](social-factors.html), [**technical**](technical-factors.md), financial, and
[**legal and policy**](legal-policy-factors.html) factors relevant to [developing a
customized business case for Web accessibility](Overview.html) for a
specific organization.

An organization's efforts to make its website accessible often have a
financial impact, and can result in positive return on investment and
cost efficiencies. Financial costs and benefits in developing accessible
websites apply differently to specific organizations and situations. For
example, costs related to Web accessibility are often lower when
building a new site than when fixing an existing site, and sometimes
complex sites are less costly to fix than simple sites because they use
templates and content management systems (CMS).

This page provides guidance on addressing financial factors in a
business case for Web accessibility.

## Identifying Financial Factors for a Specific Organization
{:#custom}


The following questions help identify how the financial aspects of Web
accessibility apply to the organization:

-   **What is the main goal for the organization's website?**<br>
    For example, if the main goal is increasing online sales, the
    business case can emphasize increasing potential market share,
    findability, and usability. See [Increased Website
    Use](#increase-use).
-   **Are there other efforts in the organization that overlap with the
    financial factors of Web accessibility?**<br>
    For example, if the organization is focusing on improving its search
    engine rankings, increasing market share, or improving usability for
    all users, the business case can show how Web accessibility helps
    those efforts. See [Increased Website Use](#increase-use).
-   **How concerned is the organization with cutting web-related
    costs?**<br>
    For example, an organization with high maintenance and upgrading
    costs can emphasize cost savings from technical improvements. See
    [Direct Cost Savings](#direct).
:    -   **Is the organization legally obligated to make its website
        accessible,** or might it be in the future?<br>
        See [Decreases potential for high legal expenses](#legal).
:    -   **Is the organization obligated to provide alternative formats
        of printed material**, or might it be in the future?<br>
        See [Decreases cost of alternative format
        materials](#alt-format).
:    -   **Does the organization provide web pages in different
        languages,** or might it in the future?<br>
        See [Decreases cost of translating](#translate).
-   **What type of web content does the organization have?**<br>
    For example, an organization with little multimedia content will
    have fewer on-going costs. See [On-Going Costs](#on-going).
-   **How does the organization update its website?**<br>
    For example, an organization with simple content updates that do not
    require rigorous testing will have few on-going testing costs. See
    [On-Going Costs](#on-going).
-   **Is the organization starting a new web development or redesign
    effort?**<br>
    If so, the business case can emphasize the cost savings of
    incorporating accessibility early in the project. See [Decreasing
    costs](#decreasing).
-   **Does the organization have several web projects?**<br>
    If so, the business case can clarify that initial costs can be
    shared among different projects. See [Decreasing
    costs](#decreasing).
-   **Is it a priority in the organization to retain the knowledge and
    experience of its older employees?**<br>
    If so, the business case can emphasize the benefits of an accessible
    intranet and internal web applications for older users. See [Direct
    Cost Savings](#direct).

See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
Overview]({% link pages/standards/wcag.md %}) for more information about the WCAG

## Increases Website Use
{:#increase-use}


A major benefit of Web accessibility is the potential for direct and
indirect financial gains from increased website use. Web accessibility
can make it easier for people to find a website, access it, and use it
successfully, thus resulting in increased audience (more users) and
increased effectiveness (more use).

Many organizations **benefit financially when more people successfully
use their website**; for example, commercial companies can get more
sales, educational institutions can get more students, and non-profit
organizations can get more funding by demonstrating successful outreach
and dissemination. Increasingly, **websites are used to cut costs** by
decreasing customer support services and letting customers complete
transactions online rather than requiring personnel and paper
interactions. The many examples of cost savings from online transactions
include citizens renewing licenses; filing tax returns and making
payments online; investors trading stock and monitoring their pension
funds online; and students registering for classes and completing course
work online. Thus, increased site use can result in financial gains and
cost savings.

*Increase in audience* (website users) can result from the following
benefits of Web accessibility:

**Increases potential use by more people, expands potential market share**{:#morepeople}
:   Accessible sites can be used by more people - including people with
    disabilities, people using mobile devices, older people, people with
    low literacy, people who are not fluent in the language of the site,
    people with low bandwidth connections to the Internet, people with
    older technologies, and new and infrequent web users, as discussed
    in [Social Factors](social-factors.html) - thus increasing the market segments
    and number of people who can successfully use the site.
:    -   An important potential market for many organizations is older
        people. People are generally living longer and older people are
        an increasingly large percentage of web users.
:    -   Accessible websites are more usable to people who have temporary
        or permanent impairments due to accident, illness, or ageing.
:    -   When web use is a significant part of a job, intranets and web
        applications that are accessible can help with employee
        recruiting and retention.
:    -   People with disabilities and older people are particularly
        likely to be loyal customers of websites that work well for
        them. Furthermore, word-of-mouth or "viral marketing" can be
        significant among these groups.

**Increases findability with search engine optimization (SEO)**{:#seo}
:   Accessibility techniques increase the findability of web pages by
    exposing content to search engines, both internally (within a
    website) and externally (across the World Wide Web). For example:
:    -   Alternative text for images and multimedia is available to
        search engines<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.8; WCAG 1.0
        checkpoint 1.1)
:    -   Most search engines access text and not images<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.5, 1.4.9; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        3.1)
:    -   Some search engines give higher weight to text that is marked up
        as headings<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 2.4.10; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        3.5)
:    -   Some search engines are unable to access some script-generated
        content such as mouse-overs<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.1.1)

:   Additional perspectives on the benefits of accessibility for SEO are
    available on the Web.

*Increase in effectiveness* (website use) can result from the following
benefits of Web accessibility:

**Increases potential use in more situations**{:#situations}
:   Accessible sites can be used in more situations. websites that can
    be used by people with disabilities can also be used more easily by
    people *without* disabilities who are limited by their situation,
    such as:
:    -   in a noisy environment<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.4, 1.2.9; WCAG 1.0
        checkpoints 1.1, 1.4)
:    -   using a small black-and-white display or a mobile device
        outdoors<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.6; WCAG 1.0
        checkpoints 2.1, 2.2)
:    -   low bandwidth<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1.1, 1.2.8, 1.4.5, 1.4.9; WCAG 1.0
        checkpoints 1.1, 3.1)

:   The [Enable Content on Different
    Configurations](technical-factors.md#repurpose) section of Technical Factors
    describes how accessibility techniques help web pages work with
    different configurations, including on [mobile
    devices](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap.html). Situational
    limitations such as [low bandwidth and older
    technology](social-factors.html#lowtech) are discussed in Social Factors.

**Increases usability**{:#usability}
:   Accessible sites are generally more usable to everyone, including
    people with disabilities and people without disabilities. Increased
    usability means website users achieve their goals effectively,
    efficiently, and satisfactorily. When users have a positive
    experience with a website, they are more likely to use the site more
    thoroughly, return to the site more often, and to tell others about
    the site ("viral marketing"). Some accessibility guidelines directly
    increase usability to all users, such as:
:    -   clear and consistent design, navigation, and links<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6, 2.4.9,
        3.2.3, 3.2.4, guideline 3.3; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 13.1, 13.3,
        13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8, 14.3)
:    -   blocks of information divided into groups<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 2.4.10; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        12.3)
:    -   clear and simple language as appropriate<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 3.1.5, 3.1.3; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        14.1)
:    -   supplemental illustrations<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 guideline 3.1; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 14.2)
:    -   good color contrast<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.3, 1.4.6; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        2.2)

:   Other accessibility guidelines can indirectly increase usability,
    for example, by making web pages load faster, as discussed in the
    [Access for People with Low Bandwidth Connections to the Internet
    and Older Technologies](social-factors.html#lowtech) section of Social Factors.

**Increases positive image**{:#image}
:   An organization's efforts in Web accessibility are a public
    relations opportunity to increase its positive image, which can
    increase website use. The [Social Factors](social-factors.html) page discusses
    Web accessibility as a social issue and an aspect of corporate
    social responsibility (CSR). CSR has been shown to improve financial
    performance, enhance brand image and reputation, increase sales and
    customer loyalty, increase ability to attract and retain employees,
    and provide access to capital and funding. Additional perspectives
    on CSR, such as statistics that show how CSR impacts customers, are
    available on the Web.

## Direct Cost Savings
{:#direct}


In addition to the benefits from increased website use discussed above,
many organizations realize direct cost savings from improving Web
accessibility.

Many of the aspects of Web accessibility that are discussed in
[Technical Factors](technical-factors.md) can provide direct cost savings:

-   **Decreases personnel costs for maintaining the site** when
    accessibility reduces site maintenance
-   **Decreases the amount of server capacity needed and saves on
    additional server costs** when accessibility reduces server load
-   **Decreases the need for creating multiple versions of a site for
    different devices** when accessibility enables content to work on
    different devices
-   **Decreases the cost of upgrading for new technologies** when
    accessibility helps take advantage of advanced web technologies and
    be prepared for future web technologies

Potential direct costs savings also result from the following benefits
of Web accessibility:

**Decreases potential for high legal expenses**{:#legal}
:   Ensuring that websites are accessible reduces the risk of high legal
    costs associated with defending against legal action for not
    complying with Web accessibility requirements. [Legal and Policy
    Factors](legal-policy-factors.html) discusses policy considerations for different
    organizations.

**Decreases cost of alternative format materials**{:#alt-format}
:   For organizations that provided printed materials in alternate
    formats (large print, embossed braille, computer disk), an
    accessible website can reduce the demand for alternate formats when
    people chose to use the Web, thus saving some production and
    distribution costs.

**Decreases cost of translating**{:#translate}
:   The cost of translating a website to other languages can be
    decreased by following accessibility guidelines for:
:    -   clear and simple language as appropriate<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 3.1.5, 3.1.3; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        14.1)
:    -   styled text instead of bitmap images of text to convey
        information<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.5, 1.4.9; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        3.1)
:    -   separating content from presentation<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 2.4.10; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
        3.3)
:    -   clear and consistent design, navigation, and links<br>
        (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6, 2.4.9,
        2.4.10, 3.1.5, 3.2.3, 3.2.4; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 13.1, 13.3,
        13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8, 14.3)

**Decreases personnel costs**{:#workers}
:   An accessible intranet and web applications can help an
    organization:
:    -   decrease training, support, and accommodation costs
:    -   help retain the valued expertise and experience of older
        employees as they develop age-related impairments
:    -   decrease the costs of recruiting and training new employees

## Cost Considerations
{:#invest}


When accessibility is incorporated from the beginning of website
development it is often a small percentage of the overall website cost.

### Initial Costs
{:#initial}

When an organization starts incorporating accessibility, there are
initial investments in acquiring knowledge, establishing processes, and
increased development and testing time.

*Personnel-related costs* associated with an initial investment in
accessibility can include:

**Providing training and skills development**
:   Providing training and skills development includes the cost of
    training and time away from other work. During skills development
    there is initially an increase in development and testing time
    because using new skills is often slower. In addition to training on
    direct accessibility issues, organizations that move to different
    technologies in an effort to improve accessibility might incur
    training costs on the new technologies.

**Hiring expertise**
:   Many organizations starting Web accessibility efforts hire
    consultants or employees with accessibility expertise, such as
    people with disabilities to help with testing.

**Incorporating accessibility into procedures**
:   Incorporating accessibility into protocols and procedures, such as
    quality assurance (QA) testing and usability evaluation, takes
    personnel time.

**Assessing existing website accessibility**
:   When fixing an existing site, assessing (auditing or evaluating)
    existing website accessibility is a common initial cost. The
    assessment cost is either a direct expense if using a service
    outside the organization, or a personnel cost if using internal
    resources. Making accessibility improvements in existing websites is
    almost always more costly in personnel time than incorporating
    accessibility during initial development or redesign.

Potential *initial capital expenditures* related to Web accessibility
include:

**Purchasing accessibility evaluation tools**
:   [Web accessibility evaluation tools](/WAI/ER/tools/) are software or
    online services that help identify accessibility problems. While
    these are not a required expense, many organizations find that using
    accessibility evaluation tools saves time and money.

**Purchasing assistive technologies**
:   Some people with disabilities use [assistive
    technologies](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html#at) to access
    the Web. Developers, designers, and evaluators sometimes use
    assistive technologies throughout the development process to
    understand how people interact with web pages and to test web pages.
    In many cases it is effective to use free assistive technologies for
    initial testing and to use people with disabilities for more
    thorough testing.

**Upgrading technologies and tools**
:   Sometimes organizations determine that it will be more efficient to
    implement accessibility with different technologies. For example,
    some organizations upgrade or change to a content management system
    (CMS) or other authoring tool that better supports production of
    accessible websites. ([Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web
    Accessibility](/WAI/impl/software.html) includes guidance on
    evaluating and selecting authoring tools.)

### On-Going Costs
{:#on-going}

While most of the costs of Web accessibility are associated with initial
accessibility efforts, there are some on-going costs to making websites
accessible, including:

**Additional development**
:   Once an organization is experienced in accessibility, incorporating
    accessibility in a web project often adds negligible extra cost.
    However, for some types of accessible content additional development
    cost or time is required, for example providing transcripts for
    podcasts and captions for multimedia.

**Additional testing**
:   Organizations committed to providing usable, accessible sites will
    likely increase testing time. Accessibility testing activities
    include:
:    -   Testing design ideas and early prototypes with users with
        disabilities and older users, and with assistive technologies
:    -   Reviewing early prototypes and final web pages for conformance
        to accessibility standards and guidelines
:    -   Quality assurance testing of specific accessibility issues, such
        as checking for missing alternative text for images

:   The information in the WAI resource [Evaluating Web Sites for
    Accessibility](/WAI/eval/) can help in determining the potential
    costs of additional testing.

## Decreasing Costs
{:#decreasing}


There are several things organizations can do to decrease the cost of
implementing accessibility, including the following:

**Incorporating accessibility from the beginning**
:   Incorporating accessibility from the beginning of a website
    development or redesign process is almost always significantly
    easier, less expensive, and more effective than making accessibility
    improvements to an existing site later as a separate project.

**Sharing accessibility resources**
:   Most costs associated with Web accessibility are investments at an
    organization level, rather than costs required for each web
    development project. In many organizations the initial costs can be
    shared among multiple projects, rather repeated for each project.

**Using authoring tools that support accessibility**
:   Using authoring tools, such content management systems (CMS), that
    support accessibility and meet [Authoring Tool Accessibility
    Guidelines (ATAG)]({% link pages/standards/atag.md %}) can help
    decrease the time and effort needed to make websites accessible.

**Addressing accessibility and mobile together**
:   Designers and developers can more efficiently develop websites
    (including applications) that work well by people using mobile
    devices and by people with disabilities, when they understand the
    significant overlap between the two and design for both together.
    The overlap between the barriers and solutions is introduced in [Web
    Content Accessibility and Mobile
    Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap).
