## Web Accessibility is a Social Issue
{:#social}


Web accessibility focuses on people with all types of disabilities -
visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological
disabilities - including older people with age-related impairments.

### Web Accessibility is Essential for Equal Opportunity

Use of the Web is spreading rapidly into most areas of society and daily
life. In many countries the Web is increasingly used for government
information and services, education and training, commerce, news,
workplace interaction, civic participation, health care, recreation,
entertainment, and more. In some cases, the Web is replacing traditional
resources and service delivery.

The Web is an important medium for receiving information as well as for
providing information and interacting with society. Therefore, **it is
essential that the Web is accessible in order to provide equal access
and equal opportunity to people with disabilities**. This basic human
right is recognized in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150),
which specifically mentions the Internet and other accessible
information and communications technologies (ICT). An accessible Web can
also help people with disabilities and older people more actively
participate in society.

**The Web is an opportunity for unprecedented access to information for
people with disabilities.** That is, the accessibility barriers to
print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through
web technologies. For example, when the primary way to get certain
information was go to a library and read it on paper, there were
significant barriers for many people with disabilities, including
getting to the library, physically getting the resource, and reading the
resource.

When that same information is also available on the Web in an accessible
format, it is significantly easier for many people to access the
information. Therefore, people with disabilities can have more effective
and efficient access to information through accessible websites — in
some cases, where there was essentially no access to it before.

**The Web is an opportunity for unprecedented *interaction* for people
with disabilities.** For example, some disabilities limit the type of
work a person can do and an accessible Web can increase their employment
options. An accessible Web also expands opportunities for communication,
social interaction, and community participation for people with
disabilities and older people with age-related impairments.

### Barriers to Web Use

Currently **there are significant barriers on the Web for many people
with disabilities**. Because most web developers do not make their web
pages and web tools accessible, many people with accessibility needs
have unnecessary difficulties using the Web, and in some cases, cannot
effectively use the Web at all. For example, when developers require
mouse interaction to use a website, people who cannot use a mouse can
have great difficulty; and when developers do not include alternative
text for important images, people who are blind cannot get the
information from images. Many of these barriers also impact older users
with accessibility needs due to ageing.

However, when websites are accessible, they enable people with
disabilities to use the Web effectively. The document [How People with
Disabilities Use the Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web)
includes scenarios that describe people with different disabilities
successfully using the Web.

### Number of People Affected (statistics)
{:#stats}

**Estimating how many people are affected by Web accessibility is
difficult** for several reasons. Countries define disability differently
and use different methods to determine the number of people with
disabilities. Some common conditions that do affect people's use of the
Web (such as color blindness) may not be considered disabilities in many
countries. Not all disabilities affect access to the Web (for example,
difficulty walking does not affect access to the Web, though difficulty
moving one's hands does). Additionally, some people do not want to
disclose their disability, and some older people do not consider their
impairments a disability.

The United Nations [Human Functioning and
Disability](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/disability/default.htm)
page includes links to data for different countries. Market research
such as [The Market for Accessible Technology - The Wide Range of
Abilities and Its Impact on Computer
Use](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/research/phase1.aspx) and
[Accessible Technology in Computing - Examining Awareness, Use, and
Future Potential](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/research/phase2.aspx)
illustrates a different approach to estimating the percentage of
computer users who might benefit from Web accessibility. The [Statistics
on People with Disabilities and Web
Use](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/resources#statecom) section of the
Resources page links to additional statistics, including on ageing
demographics and age-related impairments.

### Overlap with Digital Divide Issues

The term "digital divide" is often used to refer to economic and social
barriers to computer use for people *without* disabilities. Many people
with disabilities are affected by the same economic and social factors,
including very low rates of employment and consequently low income.
Together with barriers in the physical environment and in computer
technologies, these factors can result in:

-   lack of accessible mainstream web technologies (such as browsers and
    authoring tools)
-   lack of effective, up-to-date [assistive
    technologie](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html#at)[s](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html#at)
-   lack of opportunities for training to become proficient with web
    technologies
-   limited access to a social environment that encourages web use
-   limited access to high-bandwidth connections, or even to regular Web
    access

An organization that is committed to reducing the digital divide can
include in its business case a description of how Web accessibility can
reduce the impact of economic and social barriers to web use for people
with disabilities.

### Overlap with Mobile Access
{:#mobileoverlap}

In some parts of the world, most people use the Web only through a
mobile phone, because they do not have access to a desktop or laptop.
The overlap between mobile design/development and accessbilty is
introduced in [Web Content Accessibility and Mobile
Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap.html).

### Overlap with Older Users' Needs
{:#older}

As more people live longer and older people use the Web more, making the
Web work well for older users is becoming an increasingly important
social factor. Many older people have age-related impairments that can
affect how they use the Web, including declining:

-   vision - including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception,
    and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages
-   physical ability - including reduced dexterity and fine motor
    control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets
-   hearing - including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and
    separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other
    audio, especially when there is background music
-   cognitive ability - including reduced short-term memory, difficulty
    concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it difficult to
    follow navigation and complete online tasks

These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with
disabilities. Thus, websites and tools that are accessible to people
with disabilities are more accessible to older users as well. Specific
examples are listed in the [Access for Older People](social-factors.html#of)
section below.

For detailed research on ageing age-related impairments and Web
accessibility, see [Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
Review](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wai-age-literature).

## Web Accessibility Benefits People With and *Without* Disabilities
{:#groups}


While the main focus of Web accessibility is people with disabilities,
accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, including:

-   [older people](#of)
-   [people with low literacy or not fluent in the language](#lolit)
-   [people with low bandwidth connections or using older
    technologies](#lowtech)
-   [new and infrequent users](#newuser)
-   [mobile phone users](#mobileusers)

The [Increased Website Use](financial-factors.html#increase-use) section of Financial
Factors lists aspects of Web accessibility that increase usability, thus
also benefiting people without disabilities. People with temporary
disabilities, for example from an accident or illness, also benefit from
Web accessibility.

Below are examples of how Web accessibility benefits others. The [Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](/WAI/intro/wcag.php)
has information about the WCAG references.

### Access for Older People
{:#of}

The accessibility provisions that make the Web accessible provide many
benefits for people with age-related impairments, even though they may
not be regarded as having a disability. For example:

Older people with deteriorating vision benefit from:

-   sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors
    <br>(WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.3, 1.4.6; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    2.2)
-   text that can be increased in size so that it can be read directly
    by people with mild visual impairment without requiring assistive
    technology such as a screen magnifier; along with easy to read fonts
    and increased line spacing<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.4, 1.4.8; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.4)
-   styled text instead of bitmap images of text to convey information
    enables better browser-based enlargement<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.5, 1.4.9; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.1)
-   text and other elements that do not blink, flash or move in a way
    that distract users or cause seizures<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.2; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoints 7.2, 7.3)

Older people with reduced dexterity or fine motor control benefit from:

-   an ability to increase the clickable area of targets<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.4, 1.4.5, 1.4.8; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.4)
-   being able to use the keyboard, rather than having to use the mouse,
    for all website interaction (device independence)<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.4.7; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoints 6.4, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5)

Older people with hearing loss benefit from:

-   transcripts and captions for audio content<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.4, 1.2.8; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoints 1.1, 1.4)
-   contrast between the audio foreground "information" and background
    "noise"<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.7)

Older people with cognitive decline benefit from many of the
accessibility aspects list in the next section, Access for People with
Low Literacy and People Not Fluent in the Language.

Additional aspects of Web accessibility that benefit older users are
included in the analysis in the [Web Accessibility for Older Users: A
Literature Review](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wai-age-literature.php).

### Access for People with Low Literacy and People Not Fluent in the Language
{:#lolit}

Accessible websites benefit people with low literacy and people who are
not fluent in the language of the website. Specifically, many of the
aspects of Web accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities help
people who do not know the language well, including:

-   clear and simple language<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 3.1.5; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    14.1)
-   supplemental illustrations<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 Guideline 3.1; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 14.2)
-   clear and consistent design, navigation, and links<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.4.5,
    2.4.6, 2.4.9, 2.4.10, 3.2.3, 3.2.4, 3.3.2; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints
    13.1, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8, 14.3)
-   blocks of information divided into groups<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.10; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoint 12.3)
-   text that does not blink, flash or move too much<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.2.2; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 7.2,
    7.3)
-   provide users enough time to read and use content<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoints 7.4, 7.5)

In addition, accessible sites can be read by screen readers so people
who have difficulty reading can benefit from listening to sites.

### Access for People with Low Bandwidth Connections to the Internet or Using Older Technologies
{:#lowtech}

Some aspects of Web accessibility benefit people with low bandwidth
connections. Low bandwidth can be due to:

-   location- for example, rural areas where high speed connections are
    not available or mobile phone reception is limited
-   bandwidth congestion
-   connection technology- for example, mobile phone or personal data
    assistant (PDA)
-   financial situation- that is, cannot afford high-speed connection

Some older technologies load pages very slowly and do not support
features used on newer sites.

People with low bandwidth connections to the Internet and people with
older technologies benefit from:

-   text alternatives for images, multimedia and other non-text
    objects - for people whose older technology or mobile technology
    cannot access multimedia formats, people whose connections are too
    slow to download multimedia files, or people who turn off images and
    multimedia to limit connection charges<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1.1, 1.2.8; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    1.1)
-   redundant coding for information conveyed with color and sufficient
    contrast between foreground and background colors - for people who
    have older monitors or are viewing information outdoors where the
    sunlight makes it difficult to see the screen<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6; WCAG 1.0
    checkpoints 2.1, 2.2)
-   text size defined as relative units - for older browsers that do not
    override absolute text sizes<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.4, 1.4.8; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.4)
-   styled text instead of bitmap images of text to convey information,
    which can increase download speed<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.4.5, 1.4.9; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.1)
-   style sheets used effectively to separate content from presentation,
    which can decrease file size and file download requirements thus
    increasing download speed<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    3.3)
-   sites that are organized so they can be read and understood without
    style sheets, because some older technologies cannot handle style
    sheets (accessible pages can use style sheets and still be usable
    when style sheets are not supported)<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.3.1, 1.3.2; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    6.1)
-   sites that use valid W3C technologies and are more likely to work on
    older technologies<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 4.1.1; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 11.1,
    3.2)
-   clear and consistent design, navigation, and links, which helps
    users open the pages they want and helps save wasted page loading
    time from users going down the wrong path<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.4.1, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6, 2.4.9,
    3.2.3, 3.2.4; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 13.1, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6,
    13.7, 13.8, 14.3)

### Access for New and Infrequent Web Users
{:#newuser}

Some people have little opportunity to use the Web because of the
socioeconomic issues mentioned previously. Many older people are new
users because the Web didn't exist when they were younger. New and
infrequent web users benefit from aspects of accessibility such as:

-   clear and consistent design, navigation, and links<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.4.1, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6, 2.4.9,
    3.2.3, 3.2.4; WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 13.1, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6,
    13.7, 13.8, 14.3)
-   providing redundant text links for image maps<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 2.4.4; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    1.2)
-   informing users before new browser windows are opened<br>
    (WCAG 2.0 success criteria 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.5; WCAG 1.0 checkpoint
    10.1)

### Access for Mobile Device Users
{:#mobileusers}

For examples of how accessibility benefits people using mobile devices,
along with links to WCAG success criteria, see [Shared Web
Experiences](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences).

## Web Accessibility is an Aspect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
{:#responsible}


Web accessibility provides improved access, interaction, and social
inclusion for the people described above, which is a primary aspect of
corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Corporate social responsibility, also called corporate citizenship,
corporate responsibility, or responsible business, generally means
conducting business ethically and operating an organization in such a
way that treats internal and external stakeholders ethically, increases
human development, and is good for society and the environment. Web
accessibility can impact an organization's employees, stockholders and
board members, suppliers and vendors, partners and collaborators,
customers, and others. Thus Web accessibility is an integral part of CSR
in demonstrating an organization's commitment to providing equal
opportunities.

Just as an accessible website can demonstrate CSR, an inaccessible
website can undermine an organization's other CSR efforts.

The financial benefits of CSR are addressed in the [Increases positive
image](financial-factors.html#image) section of the Financial Factors page.

## Role of Organizations' Websites
{:#role}


When an organization's website **is not accessible, it further
excludes** people with disabilities from society. When an organization's
website **is accessible, it empowers** people with disabilities to
participate in society. Providing an accessible website is one way an
organization can demonstrate that it strives to meet the access needs of
a diverse society.
