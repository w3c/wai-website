How it Helps Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a variety of cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes: understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did something), prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome, and remember what they just did.

  <h2 id="howithelps">How it Helps</h2>
  Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a variety of
  cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes:
  <ul>
    <li>
      understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
      something),
    </li>
    <li>prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome, and</li>
    <li>remember what they just did.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, a user with age-related forgetfulness, may have
    difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press the send
    button they may not feel confident that the form was submitted. Feedback,
    such as a thank you message, will tell them submission occurred and make
    them feel confident in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can also
    assist people with attention or short-term
    cognitive and learning disabilities to remember what they are doing.
    For example, a user with early dementia may get distracted and then forget
    exactly where they were in the task. This user-action feedback helps
    re-orient them. It also helps them avoid leaving a task by reminding them
    that they are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every user
    action. When possible, the feedback should use consistent and familiar
    design patterns. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs display a
      tick, or a checkmark next to that step’s name; and, if applicable, the
      title or the name of the next step is readily apparent.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if it is a
      toggle button, the state should also be programmatically determinable).
    </li>
    <li>
      After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback
      communicating what just happened is provided, such as “Your application
      was submitted, thank you” or “Your email message was sent”.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="moredetails">More Details</h2>
  <p>
    The success or failure of every user initiated action is clearly indicated
    to the user by visual, programmatically-determinable, rapid feedback in the

      Visual state feedback. Use CSS and WAI-ARIA [[wai-aria-1.2]] states such
