  <h2 id="howithelps">How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    People with cognitive and learning disabilities make many more
    mistakes filling out forms than the general population. When mistakes cannot
    be easily corrected they cannot complete the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ability to undo errors helps people with
    cognitive and learning disabilities safely use forms and reduces the
    consequences that result from a mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that they have
    already added an item to their shopping cart and may add the item a second
    time. They may confuse the dates when booking a trip or make other mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is essential that people with
    cognitive and learning disabilities have the opportunity to check
    their work and fix their mistakes easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    For people with cognitive and learning disabilities, mistakes being
    theoretically reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
    transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may not
    have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the mistakes
    they have made. In addition, if the process of correcting mistakes is too
    difficult, users may stop, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
    items.
  </p>
  <p>
    The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating. As a result,
    many users with disabilities may stop using the Internet for many tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart at any
    time can significantly reduce mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs before
    the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify any errors and
    make changes to the order. In this example given, a summary of the purchase
    helps the user see the error in quantity as well as a higher than expected
    order total.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, a user may realize that a mistake has been made after the
    final submission of data. Provide simple language instructions on how to
    cancel transactions and help the user understand the amount of time needed
    to cancel a transaction. This makes them less susceptible to scams.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder purchasing
    a travel ticket on a web site may struggle with details and may have an
    impaired attention span. The successful completion of the order relies on
    the information provided at multiple steps in the process. An error such as
    an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing address will result in
    the order not going though. If a summary is not provided before submitting
    the final order, the user may not understand the reason for the declined
    payment and give up on the order. The user may also stop if there is not a
    clear and achievable way to make a correction.

      Change: It is simple for the user to review all the data and correct
      mistakes, including mistakes that might not be automatically identified.
      The user can change information via clearly labeled actions and get back
