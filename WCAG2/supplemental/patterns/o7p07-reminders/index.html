  <h2 id="howithelps">How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    People with cognitive and learning disabilities often have challenges
    managing events and time. (In fact, being unable to correctly manage events
    and time without support is a diagnostic criterion for some groups of
    disabilities.) This results in missing meetings, not submitting a request by
    a certain date or a form within a specified time period and missed
    opportunities. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy the day
      or time incorrectly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user is challenged processing and retaining time based information.
    </li>
    <li>The user may find it hard to sequence time-bound events.</li>
    <li>
      The user’s skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they have to
      stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using calendar
    <abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> (or task
    manager) that allow the user to automatically add events and deadlines to
    their own calendar can help.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability sets a doctor’s
    appointment online. Often they copy the details incorrectly into their
    calendar. However, in this case, the web site gives them an option to add
    the appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The user
    now comes to the correct place at the correct time with the correct papers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they can
    independently manage appointments, deadlines, and schedules. The ability to
    set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated when processing time
    bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be monitored and tracked by the
    user to ensure that they are completed in a timely manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so that the
    user does not get interrupted.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is essential not to add unwanted reminders, as this makes the user’s
    calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able to use their
    calendar at all. The user is the best person to know how many reminders, and
    which type, will best meet their needs.
