<section class="wtd">
  <h2 id="whattodo">What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    The relationship between controls and affected content should be completely
    clear and unambiguous.
  </p>
  <p>This can be achieved through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>visually grouping controls with the content they relate to,</li>
    <li>including controls within the region they affect,</li>
    <li>
      using clear dividers or white space between regions in a page that may
      have separate controls or a scroll bar,
    </li>
    <li>avoiding multiple or nested scrolling areas.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="howithelps">How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    If a control on a page operates only on part of the page, it can be hard to
    tell what it will affect and what it will not. Users may try the wrong
    control. Many users will try again, and discover the correct control or
    scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive or learning disabilities may
    not be able to work out what to do. Others will feel cognitive overload, and
    stop as a result. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is
    too complicated for them. For these users, the application will not be
    usable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clear borders and groupings on the page can help indicate what element the
    control effects. Having a border or other visual cue around the controls and
    the relevant section can help make it more understandable. Check with user
    testing that users with cognitive and learning disabilities find all
    the page relationships clear and quickly know how to use the controls.
    Testing is essential when the controls cannot be in the area they affect.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, consider a user living with dementia trying to work out which
    scrollbar to use for embedded scrollable regions. When they try the wrong
    scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire and their content may seem
    to disappear.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="moredetails">More Details</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Separate Interactive Elements</strong>. For example: Do not have
      two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to
      determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead:
      <ul>
        <li>use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars,</li>
        <li>break the content into two separate pages, or</li>
        <li>consider removing unnecessary information from the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Associate elements and their controls</strong>. Place interactive
      elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can
      impact. Keep interactive elements further from content to which they do
      not apply. (This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact
      each section of content.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use dividers</strong>. Examples of clear dividers include high
      contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a
      clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Help the user see the right control</strong>. Use large clear
      buttons and scroll bars.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Controls clearly associated with the section they control. Place the
      control inside the section, and have clear borders around the section.
      Label the controls to match the section heading. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          On a library site, a search box for the whole site is located in the
          upper right of the site’s main navigation. A second search box
          searches the library catalog. It is located within a section with a
          clear border, different background color, and a heading “Library
          Catalog”. The go button reads “search catalog”.
        </li>
        <li>
          A page needs a scrollbar for one section. The scrollbar look like it
          is inside the section.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Multiple scrollable sections where it is unclear which scrollbar to use
      for each section.
    </li>
    <li>
      Controls for one section that look like they might affect the whole page
      or another section. For example: The search box relates to one area of a
      page, and not for another area. It is unclear which area the search is
      for.
    </li>
    <li>Multiple nested scrolling regions.</li>
  </ol>
