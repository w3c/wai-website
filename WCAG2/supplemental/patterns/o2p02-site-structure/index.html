  <h2 id="whattodo">What to do</h2>
  <p>
    Make it easy to understand and use the site hierarchy and the menu
    structure.
  </p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Think about the topics covered in your content. Then organize the site
      into logical, cohesive sections.
    </li>
    <li>Use the site organization in the main menu structure.</li>
    <li>
      Create sub-menu items that are clearly and logically associated with the
      main menu items under which they fall. It should be easy to know that
      sub-menu items are there and how to get to them. Users should guess
      correctly, the first time, where to find sub menu items.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make it easy to identify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the site organization,</li>
    <li>the menu and content structure,</li>
    <li>that there are sub-menus and,</li>
    <li>if there are sub-menu items, how to reach them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="howithelps">How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Users often become confused and lost when they do not understand the visual
    hierarchy of the site, menus, and structure. Clear sub-menus and a
    well-defined structure will help the user know what is on the site and how
    to find it.
  </p>
  <p>Users often are confused when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>organization is unclear,</li>
    <li>menu terms are hard to understand, and</li>
    <li>menus and sub-menus are hard to find.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Dividing the site into clear logical sections can help. Make sections clear
    and subsections easy to find. Make the category structure and headings easy
    to understand. Create an outline that could serve as a summary of what is on
    the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The terms used in the menu need to make sense to the user. It needs to be
    obvious to the user what category the page they are looking for would fall
    under. Using common words that are familiar to the user is very important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make the levels in the content hierarchy easy to perceive and understand.
    Minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences may not be
    perceived or understood. Hierarchy solely dependent on small unique design
    elements creates confusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items may not
    be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or “rolled over”)
    as indicated by a small unique design element.
  </p>
  <p>
    When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are typically
    collapsed. Some designs may make it difficult to know that there are
    sub-menus. Some users with cognitive disabilities may not guess that
    sub-menus are present. Even if they see a menu expand by accident, they may
    not generalize that this structure may be present for other items in a menu.
    Making it easy to notice that there are sub-menu items by adding a visual
    indicator to ensure users can use all of the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are times when opening the sub-menu item may not be easy for some
    people with cognitive and learning disabilities. For example, the
    control to expand a menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of
    rolling over the area with a mouse. The end user may not figure out how to
    expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. For example, a menu that
    expands only after moving the mouse over a particular side of the menu text.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="moredetails">More Details</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Small design elements that indicate sub-menu items are not always
        meaningful to the user. Test designs with a diverse user set whenever
        possible to make sure they are clear.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consistently use best practices should be used to make it understandable
        to the user.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Series of nested elements that depend on interpreting small design
        elements are also confusing, and users may not understand the hierarchy.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Clearly indicate when text is hidden or when it can be hidden or
        revealed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Think about the types of content and categories of content in your site.
    </li>
    <li>Divide the content into clear categories.</li>
    <li>Build the main navigation from the important categories.</li>
    <li>
      If you have sub-menus, add a clear symbol that show when sub-menus are
      closed and when they are open.
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>A visually clear and logical site hierarchy.</li>
    <li>
      Clear indicators when text is hidden. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Consistently using “+” sign to show that additional information will
          be shown when pressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consistently using triangles next to hidden sub-menu items in menus.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A site hierarchy where users do not correctly guess what item is under
      each menu item.
    </li>
    <li>Unclear logic for the menu categories.</li>
    <li>
      No visual indication of sub-menu items next to the menu item. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The only way to discover the presence of the sub-menu item with a
          mouse is to move the mouse over the sub-menu item.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opening a sub-menu requires putting the mouse on part of the menu
          item, and this area is not clear and visually distinguished.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
