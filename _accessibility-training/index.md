Notes:
------

Feel free to use this material as is or adapt it for your specific
audience and goals, as long as you attribute it as described in the
["Creative Commons License (CC)" section of Using WAI
Material](http://www.w3.org/WAI/about/usingWAImaterial#cc "http://www.w3.org/WAI/about/usingWAImaterial#cc").

We encourage you to share accessibility information. Understand your own
level of knowledge (no one knows everything about accessibility), and be
careful how you address sensitive topics. Be open with your audience
about your background and level of expertise. If you get questions that
you are unsure about, it's fine to say that you don't know the answer.
That is a great opportunity to look for the answer on the [WAI
website](http://www.w3.org/WAI/yourWAI "http://www.w3.org/WAI/yourWAI")
with your audience, or say that you will find the answer later and then
ask the question on the [WAI Interest Group mailing
list](http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/#mailinglist "http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/#mailinglist").
