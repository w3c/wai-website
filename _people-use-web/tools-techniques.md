This page introduces some of the techniques and tools that people with
disabilities use to interact with the Web, such as web browser settings,
text-to-speech, voice recognition, and many more.

**Note:** This page is illustrative and is not intended to be an
exhaustive listing of all web browsing methods.

Tools and preferences {#tools}
-------------------------------

People with disabilities access and navigate the Web in different ways,
depending on their individual needs and preferences. Sometimes people
configure standard software and hardware according to their needs, and
sometimes people use specialized software and hardware that help them
perform certain tasks.

### More about tools and preferences {#more-about-tools-and-preferences}

Some common approaches for interacting with the Web include:

-   **Assistive Technologies**{:#at} – software and hardware that
    people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web.
    These include screen readers that read aloud web pages for people
    who cannot read the text, screen magnifiers for people with some
    types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection
    switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse.
-   **Adaptive Strategies**{:#as} – techniques that people with
    disabilities use to improve interaction with the Web, such as
    increasing text size, reducing mouse speed, and turning on captions.
    Adaptive strategies include techniques with standard software, with
    mainstream web browsers, and with assistive technologies.

Accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities. Features
that support accessibility are becoming increasingly available in
standard computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems, web
browsers, and other tools. [Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing
Your Computer](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing) provides
information about customizing your computer to take advantage of such
accessibility features and solutions.

Sometimes hardware and software with specific accessibility features,
including web browsers, media players, or assistive technologies, may
not be available to an individual. For instance, tools may not be
affordable, not installed or not compatible with the computer, not
available in some languages, or not available for other reasons. In
other cases, people are unaware of accessibility solutions or how to
configure and use them.


Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing {#perception}
--------------------------------------------------------

People perceive content through different senses depending on their
needs and preferences. For instance, some people are not seeing the
screen or hearing the audio. Examples of perception include:

-   **Auditory** - such as speech, music, and sound that can be *heard*.
-   **Tactile** - such as dots, bars, and vibration that can be *felt*.
-   **Visual** - such as images, text, and video that can be *seen*.

### More about perception {#more-about-perception}

Some people need to convert content from one form to another to perceive
it. For instance, someone who is deaf-blind requires audio and visual
content in a tactile form (such as [Braille](#braille){:.termref}). Other
people need to perceive content through multiple senses, such as someone
with dyslexia who may need to hear and see the text to understand it
better.

Content in textual form can be more easily converted into other forms
and is therefore particularly useful. However, text-only content poses
barriers for many people who have difficulty with written language.
Graphics and illustrations can be made accessible and often improve
understandability, ease-of-use, and satisfaction with websites and
applications for everyone.

In some cases, content can be converted into different forms using
software or hardware. For instance, a text-to-speech software can
convert text into speech. In other cases, content authors need to
provide alternative forms of the content. For example, at least some
level of human intervention is necessary to create textual descriptions
for images and captions for audio content. Sometimes software tools,
such as voice and picture recognition, can assist authors in providing
such alternatives but the conversion is usually not fully automatable.

### Examples of accessibility features {#examples-of-accessibility-features}

-   **Audio descriptions**{:#audio} – (also referred to as "video
    descriptions" and "described video") narrations that describe
    important visual details in a video. These narrations can be during
    natural pauses in the audio, or in separate audio files or audio
    tracks in multimedia.
-   **Auditory, tactile, and visual notifications**{:#notifications} -
    prompting or alerting the user in different ways such as by blinking
    or displaying visual dialogs, by using sound, or by vibration.
-   **Braille**{:#braille} – a system using six to eight raised dots in
    various patterns, to represent letters and numbers. These characters
    are read by scanning over the raised dots using the fingertips.
    Braille is used by people who are blind but not all individuals who
    are blind know braille.
-   **Captions**{:#captions} – text with a verbatim recording of any
    speech and with descriptions of relevant auditory information that
    appears simultaneously with the audio (including audio that
    accompanies video in multimedia). For real-time captioning typically
    professional CART writers are necessary.
-   **Text-to-speech**{:#tts} (sometimes called "speech synthesis" or
    "speech output") - automatic conversion of text into a synthesized
    voice reading the text aloud.
-   **Transcripts**{:#transcripts} – text manuscripts containing the
    correct sequence of verbatim recording of any speech, and
    descriptions of important auditory or visual information.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies}

-   **Refreshable Braille display**{:#braille_display} – a mechanical
    terminal that displays a line of [Braille](#braille){:.termref}
    characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins)
    dynamically. Braille devices with capabilities of small computers
    incorporate Braille displays. These devices can be used to take
    notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as
    public information kiosks.
-   **Screen reader**{:#sr} – software that processes content on the
    desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as
    [text-to-speech](#tts){:.termref} and [Braille](#braille){:.termref}.
    Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut
    keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with
    it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud.
-   **Voice browser**{:#vb} – similar to [screen reader](#sr){:.termref}
    but usually only processes web content. Voice browsers are typically
    not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for
    mobile devices or similar.

Presentation - distinguishing and understanding {#presentation}
----------------------------------------------------------------

People adjust the presentation of content to make it easier to
distinguish and understand. These adjustments include:

-   Making audio content easier to hear and visual content easier to
    see;
-   Combining audio and visual content to make information easier to
    understand;
-   Providing alternative presentations of the content, such as
    sign-language.

### More about presentation {#more-about-presentation}

Some people need larger text and image sizes or higher contrast between
text and background colors to see the content better, and some people
need louder audio with lower background noise to better hear the
content. Some people need to turn off pop-up windows and animations that
disorient or distract them. A sound that is automatically played, such
as background music on a website, can also distract people or interfere
with text-to-speech software. Web content, browsers, and tools need to
support adjusting the presentation according to peoples' needs and
preferences.

Making text more readable is of particular importance. This involves
changing its visual appearance, using additional text-to-speech, and
adapting the content. For instance, changing the font type, colors,
spacing, and line width makes texts more readable for many people.
Sometimes text-to-speech is used to assist reading further. Adapting the
content involves rearranging sections of web pages, adding functionality
such as dictionaries and glossaries, and hiding less used functionality.
While these changes are often managed using specialized web browsers and
tools, website authors need to provide adequate coding to support such
adjustments and adaptations.

Also, people process information differently. This aspect is
particularly relevant for learning environments but also applies to many
other situations. In some cases, authors can provide different
representations of the same information to address the widest audience
possible, such as graphical and tabular representations of data for
people with different learning styles, or [sign
language](#sign){:.termref} videos for sign language users.

### Examples of accessibility features {#examples-of-accessibility-features-1}

-   **Customized fonts and colors**{:#style} – changing the font types,
    sizes, colors, and spacing to make text easier to read.
    Customization involves browser settings and, for more advanced
    users, cascading style sheets (CSS) to override the default
    appearance of web content.
-   **Document outline**{:#outline} – representation of the content
    that only shows the headings and relevant structures (such as
    headings nesting and hierarchy) to help provide orientation and an
    overview of the contents.
-   **Easy-to-read text**{:#etr} – simplified summaries for passages of
    text to help make it easier to understand.
-   **Progressive disclosure**{:#progressive} – design technique that
    involves showing only the least amount of information or functions
    necessary for a given task or purpose, to avoid overloading the user
    with information.
-   **Reduced interface**{:#reduced} – representation of the content
    that only shows most relevant information or more frequently used
    functions; for instance, by hiding other parts of the content that
    can distract users.
-   **Screen magnification**{:#display} – changing the settings of the
    web browser, operating system, or screen to enlarge or reduce text
    size and images. Some people use magnification lenses, binoculars,
    or other visual aids, and software such as [screen
    magnifiers](#magnifiers){:.termref} to better see the content.
-   **Sign language**{:#sign} – a visual form of communication that is
    primarily used by people who are deaf. It involves hand, body, and
    facial expressions to transmit words, phrase, and tone. For
    instance, the intensity of a gesture could indicate the mood or
    emphasis of particular information. As in written languages, there
    are many sign languages and dialects, some of which are recognized
    as official languages in some countries. Not all people who have
    auditory disabilities or who are deaf know sign language.
-   **Symbols**{:#symbols} – icons that represent words or concepts
    used instead of text by some people with impaired communication,
    including people with difficulties to read or write.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies-1}

-   **Pop-up and animations blockers**{:#blockers} – web browser
    plug-ins or other software tools that stop automatic pop-up windows
    and redirection, and options to stop, pause, and hide animations.
-   **Reading assistants**{:#reading} – software that changes the
    presentation of content and provides other functionality to make it
    more readable. Examples include:
    -   Customizing the font type, size, spacing, or foreground and
        background colors;
    -   Scanning the text for complex words and phrases, and linking
        them to glossaries;
    -   Hiding less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and
        header areas;
    -   Providing outlines of the page headings and summaries of the
        text passages;
    -   Reading the content aloud and highlight the text as it is being
        read out loud.
-   **Screen magnifier**{:#magnifiers} – software used primarily by
    people with partial sight to enlarge the content to make it easier
    to see. Some screen magnifiers provide
    [text-to-speech](#tts){:.termref} and other functionality.
-   **Volume control**{:#volume} – options to adjust the volume of
    audio content being played, including options to turn off the sound
    altogether, that are separate from the overall system settings.

Input - typing, writing, and clicking {#input}
-----------------------------------------------

People use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. For
instance, some people do not use a mouse, keyboard, or both, while
others use specific configurations for keyboard and mouse, or use
alternative hardware and software altogether. Examples of input include
using:

-   Keyboard only by people with cognitive, physical, and visual
    disabilities;
-   Touch screen only by people with cognitive and physical
    disabilities;
-   Mouse and keyboard with software that compensates for hand tremor;
-   Voice recognition (speech input) and other hands-free interaction.

### More about input {#more-about-input}

Some people use software and customized settings to enhance the
efficiency of typing, writing, and clicking. For instance, some people
assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use. Some
people use word prediction software to help complete words and sentences
with minimal typing, grammar and spelling tools to help correct text,
and tools to help click, select text, and scroll with minimal movement.

Web content needs to be designed to support these different types of
approaches. For instance, forms, links, and other functionality need to
be usable by keyboard. In particular, web applications ("client-side
scripting"), embedded media players, and other programmatic objects need
to provide full keyboard support that does not trap the keyboard focus
within the program and larger clickable areas for buttons and links.

Accessible web content supports people who need more time typing,
writing, and clicking, or are more likely to make mistakes. For
instance, some people forget to select options and fill out form
entries, misspell words and mistype data (such as dates), or
unintentionally activate buttons and links. Accessible web content also
provides enough time to complete tasks, clear and helpful error messages
and options for correcting input.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies-2}

-   **Accelerators**{:#accelerators} – software and functionality that
    help reduce the effort needed to type or click. For instance, by
    providing options to create shortcuts for commands or sequences of
    commands, by highlighting selection choices such as menu items,
    links, or options, and by helping to steer the mouse.
-   **Alternative keyboard and mouse**{:#input} – hardware and software
    primarily used by people with cognitive and physical disabilities to
    help interact with the computer. Examples include:
    -   Keyboards with larger keys, key labels, key spacing, illuminated
        keys, or custom layouts;
    -   On-screen keyboards, touch-screens, sip-and-puff switches, and
        single-key switches;
    -   Trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, specially designed mice, and
        other pointing devices;
    -   [Voice recognition](#voice){:.termref}, [eye
        tracking](#gaze){:.termref}, and other approaches for hands-free
        interaction.
-   **Eye tracking**{:#gaze} (sometimes called "eye-gaze") - a system
    that monitors eye movement to control the mouse pointer and detects
    blinking to initiate mouse clicks.
-   **Keyboard customization**{:#kbd} – includes changing the mapping
    of keys, assigning shortcut keys to functions, setting
    [filters](#filters){:.termref}, and setting "sticky keys" to support
    single-handed typing.
-   **Keyboard and mouse filters**{:#filters} – functions of the
    operating system or software tools that recognize and compensate for
    involuntary movements such as tremor and spasms.
-   **Mouse customization**{:#mouse} – includes changing the mapping of
    buttons, changing the sensitivity of the mouse towards movement,
    setting [filters](#filters){:.termref}, and changing the size and
    appearance of the mouse pointer.
-   **On-screen keyboard**{:#screenkbd} – virtual keyboard displayed on
    a screen so that it can be used with a touchscreen, mouse,
    trackball, joystick, or other pointing devices.
-   **Spelling and grammar tools**{:#lexical} – web browser functions,
    plug-ins, or other software tools to help users write.
-   **Voice recognition**{:#voice} (sometimes called "speech input" or
    "voice command") - software that recognizes the human voice and can
    be used to dictate text or to issue commands to operate the
    computer.
-   **Word prediction**{:#prediction} – software that presents
    selections of matching words, phrases, or sentences based on the
    current input (and sometimes context) to save typing.

    syndrome](stories#supermarketassistant)


Interaction - navigating and finding {#interaction}
----------------------------------------------------

People navigate and find content using different strategies and
approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities. For
instance, someone using a website for the first time may need clearer
guidance than someone who has more experience with the particular site,
and someone using the Web on a mobile device with a small screen may
require more orientational cues than someone using a desktop computer.
While these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and
without disabilities, some situations affect people with disabilities to
a greater extent.

### More about interaction {#more-about-interaction}

Examples of such situations include:

-   A person is not seeing the screen and needing to get an overview and
    orient themselves by scanning the headings on a web page; the
    headings need to be also designed to support such purposes.
-   A person who is only seeing small portions of the screen at a time
    due to screen magnification, and need to orient themselves using
    visual cues; the visual design needs to also support such purposes.
-   A person using only the keyboard (or keyboard alternatives) to
    navigate through the web content; the structure of web pages need to
    be designed to also support and efficient use of the keyboard.
-   A person who has difficulty remembering the addresses, names, or
    particular functionality of websites; web browsers need to provide
    supporting functionality that is easy to use and remember.
-   A person who may have difficulty with hierarchical menu navigation,
    as how most navigation menus are designed to be; websites need to
    provide alternative mechanisms for navigation.

Many functions to support different styles of navigation are built
directly into web browsers and assistive technologies. For instance,
most commonly available browsers provide bookmark functionality, and
screen readers provide functions to list headings, links, and other
structures on a web page. However, the design of the content is also an
essential factor to support different styles of navigation.

### Examples of accessibility features {#examples-of-accessibility-features-2}

-   **Consistency and predictability**{:#consistency} – labeling of
    functions such as links, buttons, and controls should be consistent,
    and the expected function should be predictable from the label.
-   **Descriptive titles, headings, and labels**{:#labels} – page
    titles, section headings, and labels for forms, links, and controls
    are sometimes read on their own or out of context and need to be
    descriptive.
-   **Helpful error and success messages**{:#messages} – dialogs and
    other messages, such as after submitting forms, need to help users
    complete their tasks and avoid disorientation, distraction,
    confusion, or discomfort.
-   **Multiple navigation mechanisms**{:#navigating} – websites need to
    provide multiple ways to locate web pages, for instance by providing
    sitemaps and search functionality in addition to hierarchical
    navigation menus.
-   **Skip links**{:#skip} – mechanisms to allow keyboard users to skip
    over repetitive blocks of content such as page headings, navigation
    bars, or menus. Note: too many skip links are counterproductive to
    this purpose.
-   **Visual orientation cues**{:#cues} – examples include using
    background colors to indicate different parts of the content, using
    unique headings, and placing relevant information in prominent areas
    of a web page.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies-3}

-   **Bookmarks and history**{:#bookmarks} – using web browser
    functions to help remember pages, find previously visited pages, or
    quickly go to pages without needing to type a web address.
-   **Keyword search**{:#search} – using web browser functions to find
    text within a web page, and website functionality to search for web
    pages by keyword. Search engines that are maintained and optimized
    for a particular website can provide more precise search results.
-   **Keyboard navigation**{:#keyboard} – moving through the content
    using the keyboard, typically by using the tab key to jump from one
    structural item such as link, header, or list item, to the next.
    Keyboard navigation largely depends on web browser support but also
    on website design features such as [skip links](#skip){:.termref}.
-   **Page maps**{:#maps} – displaying a small image of the entire web
    page with an indicator highlighting the portion within the web page
    that is being currently viewed.
-   **Pictorial links**{:#pictorial} – some web browsers, plug-ins, and
    websites show small images of the link targets (sometimes called
    "screen shots") rather than the addresses or names; for instance in
    combination with [bookmarks and history](#bookmarks){:.termref}
    listings, back and forward buttons in web browsers, or links on web
    pages.
