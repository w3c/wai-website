This page explores the wide range of diversity of people and abilities
and highlights some of the types of web accessibility barriers that
people commonly encounter due to inaccessible designs of websites and
web tools.

**Note:** This page is illustrative and is not intended to be an
exhaustive listing of all disabilities and barriers.

Diversity of abilities {#diversity}
------------------------------------

There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of
auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For
instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or
accident, or they may develop impairments with age. Some may not
consider themselves to have disabilities even if they do experience such
functional limitations.

### More about diversity of abilities {#more-about-diversity-of-abilities}


Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, tools,
preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. For
instance, consider the following aspects:

-   **Age-related impairments:**{:#ageing} Many people develop
    age-related impairments. While they share the same functional
    requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are
    significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the
    level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general.
-   **Multiple disabilities:**{:#combined} Some people have
    combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit
    their approaches for interacting with the Web. For instance, someone
    who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for
    audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color.
-   **Health conditions:**{:#health} Some people have health conditions
    that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For
    instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that
    could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit
    the duration or extent of their use of the Web.
-   **Changing abilities:**{:#changing} Some people may be experiencing
    progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their
    use of the Web differently at different times. For instance, some
    may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or
    none on another day, depending on their condition.
-   **Temporary impairments:**{:#temporary} Some people may be
    experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due
    to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about
    accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility
    features, and may be unaware of their needs.
-   **Situational limitations:**{:#situational} Some people may be
    experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other
    situational aspects. For instance, they may be in a loud environment
    and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a
    screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies.

Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of
abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities. It
is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional
needs rather than to categorize people according to medical
classifications.


Auditory {#auditory}
---------------------

Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or
both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing
loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities
can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech,
especially when there is background noise. This can include people using
hearing aids.

### More about auditory disabilities {#more-about-auditory-disabilities}


While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with
auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not
designed to be accessible. For instance, while video content can be used
to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have
alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible
for people with auditory disabilities.

To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely
on:

-   Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only
    content and audio tracks in multimedia;
-   Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust
    the text size and colors of captions;
-   Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content
    (independently of the system volume);
-   High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from
    any background noise.

For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary
language, and they may not read the written language as fluently.
Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text
that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help
make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is
important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities
know sign language.


### Examples of auditory disabilities {#examples-of-auditory-disabilities}


-   **Hard of hearing**{:#hardofhearing} – mild or moderate hearing
    impairments in one or both ears.
-   **Deafness**{:#deafness} – substantial, uncorrectable impairment of
    hearing in both ears.
-   **Deaf-blindness**{:#deafblindness} – substantial, uncorrectable
    hearing and visual impairments.


### Examples of barriers for people with auditory disabilities {#examples-of-barriers-for-people-with-auditory-disabilities}


-   Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without
    captions or transcripts.
-   Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide
    volume controls.
-   Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size
    and colors for captions.
-   Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on
    interaction using voice only.
-   Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text
    that is difficult to read.

Cognitive, learning, and neurological {#cognitive}
---------------------------------------------------

Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve
neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and
mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may
affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear,
move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and
neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of
a person.

### More about cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities {#more-about-cognitive-learning-and-neurological-disabilities}


Computer technologies and the Web provide many opportunities for people
with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities to interact with
content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them.
For instance, people can navigate web content using different
strategies, access information in text, audio, or other formats, and
change the presentation of the content according to their individual
needs or preferences.

Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and
neurological disabilities often rely on:

-   Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and
    orientation;
-   Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;
-   Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;
-   Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and
    search;
-   Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise
    distracting content;
-   Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other
    illustrations;

People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use
different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular
needs. For instance, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the
information while reading it visually or use captions to read the
information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and
spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and
spelling tools to support writing. For these web browsing methods to
work, developers need to consider web accessibility requirements which
are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual
disabilities.


### Examples of cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities {#examples-of-cognitive-learning-and-neurological-disabilities}


-   **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**{:#adhd}
    (formerly "attention deficit disorder (ADD)") – involves difficulty
    focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being
    easily distracted.
-   **Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**{:#asd} (includes “autism,”
    “Asperger syndrome,” and “pervasive developmental disorder” (PDD)) -
    involves impairments of social communication and interaction
    abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests.

    regions) – involves impairments of intelligence, learning more
    slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome
    is one among many different causes of intellectual disabilities.
-   **Learning disabilities**{:#learning} – is a functional term rather
    than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe
    and some other countries, it refers to [intellectual
    disabilities](#intellectual){:.termref}, while in Australia, Canada,
    the U.S., and some other countries it refers to [perceptual
    disabilities](#perceptual){:.termref}.
-   **Mental health disabilities**{:#mhealth} – includes anxiety,
    delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other
    disorders. These conditions may cause difficulty focusing on
    information, processing information, or understanding it. In
    particular medication for these disorders may have side effects
    including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments.
-   **Memory impairments**{:#memory} – involves limited short-term
    memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall
    language. Dementia is one among many different causes of memory
    impairments.

    "[learning disabilities](#learning){:.termref}" in Australia, Canada,
    the U.S., and some other countries) – involves difficulty processing
    auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can
    impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers
    (dyscalculia), or spatial and temporal orientation.

Physical {#physical}
---------------------

Physical disabilities (sometimes called "motor disabilities") include
weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary
movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis),
limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that
impedes movement, and missing limbs.

### More about physical disabilities {#more-about-physical-disabilities}


To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized
hardware and software such as:

-   Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse;
-   Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing;
-   On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing
    devices;
-   Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other
    movements;
-   Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free
    interaction.

People with physical disabilities may be using a mouse or mouse-like
device only, or keyboard or keyboard-like device only to operate the
computer. People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to
activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to
type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single
keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes
("chording") to activate commands. Such keystrokes include commands for
special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items.

People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas
and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing
large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error
correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other
important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the
current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page
headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual
disabilities share many of these requirements.


### Examples of physical disabilities {#examples-of-physical-disabilities}


-   **Amputation**{:#limbs} – includes missing fingers, limbs, or other
    parts of the human body.
-   **Arthritis**{:#arthritis} (previously called
    "[rheumatism](#rheumatism){:.termref}") – inflammation, degeneration,
    or damage to the joints.
-   **Fibromyalgia**{:#fibromyalgia} (formerly called
    "[rheumatism](#rheumatism){:.termref}") – the chronic pain of muscle
    and connective tissues.
-   **Rheumatism**{:#rheumatism} – typically refers to
    [arthritis](#arthritis){:.termref} and other causes of bone or joint
    pain, and sometimes to [fibromyalgia](#fibromyalgia){:.termref} and
    other causes for muscular and other soft tissue pain.
-   **Reduced dexterity**{:#dexterity} – is a functional term (rather
    than a medical condition) that describes the ability to control the
    hand, such as hand-eye coordination of people with cognitive and
    neurological disabilities.
-   **Muscular dystrophy**{:#md} – progressive weakness and
    degeneration of muscles, sometimes including in arms and hands.
-   **Repetitive stress injury (RSI)**{:#rsi} (also called "repetitive
    motion disorder" (RMD) and "cumulative trauma disorder" (CT)) -
    involves injuries to the musculoskeletal system (bones, joints,
    tendons, and other connective tissues) and the nervous system from
    repetitive tasks and damage.
-   **Tremor and spasms**{:#tremor} – involuntary movement or muscle
    contraction, including short twitches, and continual or rhythmic
    muscle contractions.
-   **Quadriplegia**{:#quadriplegia} (sometimes called "tetraplegia") -
    partial or total paralysis (includes motor control and sensation) to
    all four body limbs (legs and arms) and the torso.


### Examples of barriers for people with physical disabilities {#examples-of-barriers-for-people-with-physical-disabilities}


-   Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full
    keyboard support.
-   Insufficient time limits to respond or to complete tasks, such as to
    fill out online forms.
-   Controls, including links with images of text, that do not have
    equivalent text alternatives.
-   Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and
    other navigational aids.
-   Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation
    mechanisms and page functions.

    short-term memory loss](stories#retiree)


Speech {#speech}
-----------------

Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is
recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For instance,
the loudness or clarity of someone's voice might be difficult to
understand.

### More about speech disabilities {#more-about-speech-disabilities}


People with speech disabilities encounter barriers with voice-based
services, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that
are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice,
people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction
such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and
keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that
provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an
organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities.
Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms.


### Examples of speech disabilities {#examples-of-speech-disabilities}


-   **Apraxia of speech (AOS)**{:#apraxia} – includes inconsistent
    articulation and production of speech sounds, and errors producing
    sounds in the correct order so that spoken words or phrases become
    difficult to understand.
-   **Cluttering**{:#cluttering} (also called "tachyphemia") – includes
    increased speaking rate, incorrect rhythm, intonation, and
    co-articulation of sounds, and other influent speech that is
    sometimes similar to [stuttering](#stuttering){:.termref}.
-   **Dysarthria**{:#dysarthria} – involves weakness or complete
    paralysis of muscles that are necessary to produce speech, including
    lips, lungs, throat, tongue, and others.
-   **Speech sound disorder**{:#sound} – involves difficulty or
    inability to produce certain sounds or patterns of sound and
    sometimes results in addition, distortion, omission, or substitution
    of such sounds with others.
-   **Stuttering**{:#stuttering} – includes influent speech, repetition
    of individual sounds or entire words and phrases, and misplacement
    or prolongation of pauses and sounds while speaking that is
    different from [cluttering](#cluttering){:.termref}.
-   **Muteness**{:#muteness} (also called "mutism") – involves the
    inability to speak due to various reasons such as anxiety, brain
    injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech.


### Examples of barriers for people with speech disabilities {#examples-of-barriers-for-people-with-speech-disabilities}


-   Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on
    interaction using voice only.
-   Websites that offer phone numbers as the only way to communicate
    with the organizations.


Visual {#visual}
-----------------

Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or
both eyes ("low vision") to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in
both eyes ("blindness"). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity
to certain colors ("color blindness"), or increased sensitivity to
bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness
can be independent of the visual acuity.

### More about visual disabilities {#more-about-visual-disabilities}


People with visual disabilities typically rely on changing the
presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their
particular needs. For example by:

-   Enlarging or reducing text size and images;
-   Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;
-   Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;
-   Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;
-   Reading text using refreshable Braille.

For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that
the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying
structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be
processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive
technologies. For instance, some people do not see the content and rely
on lists, headings, tables, and other page structures to be properly
coded so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive
technologies.

Some people are only seeing small portions of the content at a time or
are perceiving the colors and design differently. Some people are using
customized fonts, colors, and spacing to make the content more readable,
or they are navigating through the content using keyboard only because
they cannot see the mouse pointer. An accessible design supports
different presentations of the web content and different ways of
interaction.


### Examples of visual disabilities {#examples-of-visual-disabilities}


-   **Color blindness**{:#colorblindness} – includes difficulty
    distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or
    between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability to perceive any
    color.
-   **Low vision**{:#lowvision} – (in some regions also called "partial
    sight") includes poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel
    vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field), central field
    loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded
    vision.
-   **Blindness**{:#blindness} – substantial, uncorrectable loss of
    vision in both eyes.
-   **Deaf-blindness**{:#deafblind} – substantial, uncorrectable visual
    and hearing impairments.


### Examples of barriers for people with visual disabilities {#examples-of-barriers-for-people-with-visual-disabilities}


-   Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have
    equivalent text alternatives.
-   Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose
    information when resized.
-   Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and
    other navigational aids.
-   Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an
    audio-description track.
-   Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation
    mechanisms and page functions.
-   Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and
    background color combinations.
-   Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the
    use of custom color combinations.
-   Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full
    keyboard support.
