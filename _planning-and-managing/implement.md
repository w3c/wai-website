Build skills and expertise {#build-skills-and-expertise}
--------------------------

Improve accessibility awareness and develop core skills for key staff.

Develop the accessibility skills of everyone involved, including
designers, developers, content creators, and managers. This includes
providing training for existing staff, as well as including
accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training
include:

-   **Introductions to accessibility** for everyone
-   **How accessibility benefits your business** for management and
    project managers
-   **Accessible visual design** for designers and marketing
-   **Accessible coding solutions** for developers and testers
-   **Writing accessible content** for non-technical content authors

Document and share experience gathered throughout the processes to build
expertise in creating accessible websites. Consider how to capture and
communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques.
Include what didn't work, as well as what did, to avoid time being spent
on approaches known to have problems.

Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of
accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice. Increase
knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time,
helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk.

Integrate goals into policies {#integrate-goals-into-policies}
-----------------------------

Create a policy framework that builds accessibility throughout the
organization.

Integrate the goals from your accessibility policy within other
organizational procedures and policies. This will help spread the
responsibility but also ensure that accessibility is considered as an
integral part of day-to-day activities.

The following are some examples of where incorporating accessibility can
bring broad benefits.

-   **Recruitment policies** – Include relevant accessibility skills in
    general recruitment briefs and policies, to support the recruitment
    of staff expertise.
-   **Staff training** – Provide accessibility training as part of staff
    and career development plans, to support the development of staff
    expertise.
-   **Document publishing process** – Incorporate accessibility checks
    as part of your web content publishing workflow, to ensure that good
    practice is maintained and that final web content continues to be
    accessible.
-   **Procurement process** – Ensure that suppliers are aware of your
    accessibility requirements by including criteria in any request for
    quotations and contracts.

Depending on your organization there may be several other relevant
procedures or policies that involve accessibility, such as equal
employment policies, workspace accommodation, and customer care.

    policy]({% link _planning-and-managing/plan.md %}#create-accessibility-policy)

Assign tasks and support delivery {#assign-tasks-and-support-delivery}
---------------------------------

Assign tasks according to the set objectives and identified
responsibilities. Track progress on the tasks and provide support where
needed.

Communicate deliverables and assignments to assigned team members.
Ensure staff know what is expected of them, that they have the necessary
capabilities, and are clear on schedules. Ensure that everyone has the
resources to help them with their tasks. Provide a clear process for
people to flag issues and ensure that any issues raised are managed and
responded to efficiently.

Individuals in multi-disciplinary teams are likely to have
responsibility for meeting different parts of your accessibility
standard. Be specific about each individual's responsibility. For
example, visual designers may be responsible for success criteria
concerned with the visual elements of content, and developers are
concerned with those related to the underlying code. Similarly, a
contracts team may be responsible for ensuring that the procurement
process includes accessibility requirements for third-party content.

Depending on organization size, you may consider an accessibility task
force that meets regularly to coordinate and verify progress among
departments.

Evaluate early and regularly {#evaluate-early-and-regularly}
----------------------------

Find and fix issues early in the process to reduce risk and cost.

Evaluate accessibility throughout the design and development process,
and particularly at key milestones and sprints. Evaluate key web pages,
processes, and stand-alone components as they become available. Avoid
evaluating accessibility separately and integrate checks iteratively
within any current testing and quality assurance processes.

Early evaluations of designs help identify problems and potential
problems before significant work takes place. Other design resources,
such as personas and user stories, can also be reviewed to include
accessibility considerations. This will help designers better understand
how people with disabilities interact with your website.

Include input from users with disabilities as part of your evaluations.
Encourage team members to attend testing sessions as this provides
insight and context into barriers experienced by users.

Use a standard report structure to capture evaluation findings. This
allows for comparisons between different websites and across versions of
the same website. Raise accessibility issues in an issue tracking system
to ensure that it is allocated resources and fixed as part of the
standard quality assurance cycle.

Prioritize issues {#prioritize-issues}
-----------------

Use resources effectively by addressing high impact, easy-to-resolve
issues first.

While all accessibility objectives will need to be met, prioritizing can
help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization
include:

-   Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation
    in the team and demonstrate success.
-   Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to
    support the creating of accessible content.
-   Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding
    activity within the organization.
-   Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to support
    anticipated hiring and acquisitions.
-   De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a
    content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed
    soon anyway.

Involve different perspectives, including internal and external
stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation
regularly to benefit from arising opportunities.

    Website](/WAI/impl/improving#prioritize) – Describes further
    prioritization criteria.

Track and communicate progress {#track-and-communicate-progress}
------------------------------

Monitor progress towards accessibility goals and share the good and bad
to maintain awareness and support.

Track the progress made towards your accessibility objectives according
to the assigned responsibilities and planned schedule. This includes
progress on:

-   Web content accessibility
-   Implementation of procedures and policies
-   Staff training and knowledge sharing
-   Organizational awareness and attitude

Share accessibility achievements, in particular with management, to help
maintain and increase support for accessibility activities.
Communicating lack of achievement can help highlight insufficient
support or other systemic challenges and focus management on the need
for urgent attention.

Regular communication can help make the benefits of and challenges with
accessibility implementation more transparent and easier to understand
by your peers. For example, sharing successful training sessions,
resources, and tools across departments could leverage knowledge and
skills.

Possible communication opportunities include:

-   Reporting issue clearance rate to project management.
-   Share highlight videos from user experience sessions with
    accessibility champions.
-   Developer workshops to share good practice approaches.
