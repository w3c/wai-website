Careful planning is critical to effective implementation of any
accessibility effort. It ensures a clear assessment of the required
work, distribution of tasks, and continual follow-up on progress.

Create accessibility policy {#create-accessibility-policy}
---------------------------

Document the accessibility goals, scope, and responsibilities important
to your organization.

A web accessibility policy captures your goals and targets. Policies
vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what web
accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when. For example,
your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria
specified in WCAG 2.0 Level AA within one year. A policy may cover other
topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation
processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. This will
help all implementation activities, ensuring that resources are
available and activities are prioritized.

    Accessibility]({% link _planning-and-managing/implement.md %}) – Provides information on what needs
    to be considered when creating your policy.

Assign responsibilities {#assign-responsibilities}
-----------------------

Understand what roles are needed to ensure all tasks are covered.

Responsibility for delivering accessibility needs to be assigned to
specific individuals and incorporated into their job description.
Formalizing the responsibility helps ensure that the individual has time
for the work and can receive training. Clear identification also helps
communicate who is responsible for accessibility and that it is being
prioritized.

It is important to recognize that implementing accessibility is not only
a concern for developers, but for the whole team. Spreading
responsibilities throughout your project and organization increases
awareness and reduces the risk of the activities overwhelming an
individual or team. Some example responsibilities include:

-   **Marketing** – Embed accessibility within brand or design
    guidelines.
-   **Quality assurance** – Test for and track accessibility issues
    within the code.
-   **Development** – Maintain code libraries with accessible
    components.
-   **Purchasing** – Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is
    incorporated within procurement processes.
-   **Acceptance testing** – Ensure that any agency-delivered website or
    component meets your desired level of accessibility.
-   **Recruitment** – Incorporate accessibility skills within
    recruitment profiles.

Determine budget and resources {#determine-budget-and-resources}
------------------------------

Ensure resources, including budgets, are clarified and secured for
accessibility activities. This includes necessary reviews, training,
audits, and testing with users.

Your budget and resource needs depend on your accessibility goals and
the extent of the work required to achieve them. For all activities
consider what resources will be required and ensure that that they are
available. Some things that need to be considered include:

-   **Accessibility evaluations** – Consider how frequently they need to
    occur and how extensive they need to be.
-   **Evaluation with people** – Consider what opportunities exist to
    involve users with disabilities in evaluations.
-   **Reviews of policies and procedures** – Time required to determine
    which policies need to be change, time required to make the changes,
    and time required to implement the changes.
-   **Recruitment** – Organizations and teams may benefit from
    recruiting accessibility specialists or coordinators.
-   **Staff training** – General awareness raising as well as specific
    training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as
    website development or content writing.
-   **Tooling** – Adaptation or possible replacement of content
    authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or
    acquiring accessibility evaluation tools.
-   **Experienced support** – Additional external support may be
    necessary while staff skills and knowledge improves.

Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval.
Your business case helps to secure budget, and you should ensure that
the final budget is supported by estimates of how changes impact on
previously set objectives and targets, and what return on investment
could be expected. This might include better website performance,
reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor
statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.

Review environment {#review-environment}
------------------

Consider resources, processes, and tools in your organization that may
impact accessibility efforts.

The environment in which your websites are created and maintained has an
equally significant impact on their accessibility. Also review these
surrounding aspects, including:

-   How well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining
    accessible content; for example, does the content management system
    (CMS) support your accessibility commitments?
-   What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the
    staff creating and maintaining your websites? How well is training
    support provided to improve the situation?
-   Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing
    accessibility?
-   Can accessibility be improved in design and development guidelines
    and specifications, shared templates and coding libraries, common
    authoring practices, and other centralized resources?
-   Does any quality assurance plan include specific accessibility
    checks?
-   How well do the existing policies and processes support your
    undertaking; for example, are there procurement policies to ensure
    purchasing of accessible tools and content?

Having clear understanding of the issues will help you better address
them. For example, you may identify that by improving the content
management system (CMS) or with training, you can achieve your
accessibility objectives much more effectively.

Review websites {#review-websites}
---------------

Identify issues to be fixed or avoided in existing websites.

Perform a detailed accessibility review of websites in the scope of your
objectives. This can create a baseline for future work, identify where
training or additional expertise is needed, and help clarify how big a
problem exists. The review may highlight instances of good practice,
which identifies staff or suppliers who have critical skills to build
on.

Review results are helpful to identify problems to be avoided in future
work, even if the objectives involve completely replacing an existing
website. Results are also helpful in stakeholder reporting activities.
Highlight existing problems and their impact so that later on, the
impact of positive change can be put into context.

Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of the process, not
only when the website is completed. For example, color choices can be
checked on mocked-up website designs. By starting early and checking
throughout the project you reduce the risk of being constrained by early
design decisions that become expensive to change later on. Expert
assistance may be required if your available resources do not have the
skills and experience needed to undertake a thorough review.

Establish monitoring framework {#establish-monitoring-framework}
------------------------------

Create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings, in order to
track and progress.

Defined milestones help you measure your progress. Ensure that each
milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress
has occurred.

Some example criteria include:

-   Number of WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria passed, and their level.
-   Number of complaints received related to accessibility.
-   Calls handled from people who were unable to process their
    application online.
-   Positive social media comments on accessibility of service.
-   Training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff.

Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all
parts of your organization that have been assigned any accessibility
responsibility.

It is valuable to develop a standard report structure to capture the
measure of accessibility for websites or tools. This allows for
comparisons between different websites and also between different
versions of the same website.

For long-term or ongoing goals you need to plan regular monitoring to
ensure that achieved goals do not slip. For example, updates to content
and website maintenance work may introduce new accessibility barriers or
new staff may not have the necessary skills. Plan for regular reviews to
monitor progress over time. Ensure that responsibility is assigned for
the checks and there are clear escalation paths for identified issues.

Engage with stakeholders {#engage-with-stakeholders}
------------------------

Maintain long-term support through regular communication with management
and other stakeholders.

Engage with your stakeholders to bring them on board and to identify how
they can help you meet your accessibility goals. This includes internal
stakeholders such as project teams, marketing, and management, as well
as external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and
customers. For example:

-   Introduce accessibility aspects in marketing campaigns.
-   Report progress to management.
-   Negotiate with suppliers to better support you with accessibility.
-   Find out the latest accessibility trends for advocates and
    champions.
-   Provide feedback channels to engage with your customers and
    end-users.

Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase
internal commitment for accessibility. A public accessibility statement
that identifies parts of your websites that work well and less well,
explains accessibility improvements to come, and provides contact
options for customers to report problems can help you overcome the
transition period and gather feedback to prioritize repairs.
