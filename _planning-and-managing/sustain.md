Keeping momentum helps with the accessibility maintenance for completed
projects and builds on completed work for new projects. Regular reviews
of content, organizational processes, and resources will help ensure
that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified.
Developing a management reporting process will help ensure that it is
clear where activity is required for follow-up work.

Monitor websites {#monitor-websites}
----------------

Changing content can introduce accessibility issues, and provide
opportunities for improvement. Monitor changes to identify issues and
solutions.

Coordinate closely with website owners to identify opportunities for
improvement. This includes daily content publishing and maintenance
activities, as well as broader redesign and development efforts. For
example, knowing when website updates are scheduled and their scope can
help reprioritize accessibility tasks to minimize effort.

As your website content changes, ensure that regular accessibility
reviews are performed. Include accessibility checks within the
publishing process to help reduce the risk of issues occurring. Also
provide a consistent evaluation process and reporting template. This
will help comparison of findings to identify trends across websites or
teams and help in management reporting activities.

Reviews should seek to identify issues and also identify why those
issues are occurring. Some questions to consider:

-   Are issues caused by staff members who have not had sufficient
    training?
-   Are they as a result of a change in the content management system
    (CMS)?
-   Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear?

Take action to correct the issues and also to remedy the reason for the
issues occurring.

Engage with stakeholders {#engage-with-stakeholders}
------------------------

Work with stakeholders to continually prioritize accessibility.

Continued engagement with stakeholders will ensure that they are aware
of the improvements in accessibility and resulting benefits. Internal
stakeholders may be interested in how this is impacting the business and
the effects on key performance indicators.

External stakeholders are more likely to be interested in how your
organization is progressing towards fulfilling stated accessibility
goals. Keep working with external suppliers to improve the services and
tools that they deliver.

Work with internal stakeholders to ensure that accessibility remains a
priority, particularly when it comes to new projects. Long-term
engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting
project delivery. Are projects costing more? Is less time needed to
ensure that accessibility is covered? Are there less problems at the end
of projects?

Changes in organizational structure may also be considered in the
long-term and require the strategic view that senior stakeholders have.
Examples include:

-   Provide subject matter experts within each development team.
-   Build accessibility support services within the organization.
-   Prioritize accessibility during restructuring.

Track standards and legislation {#track-standards-and-legislation}
-------------------------------

Keep up-to-date with changes to ensure that you are responding to the
latest requirements.

Review changes in standards and legislation that form part of your
Accessibility Policy and consider any new standards or legislation that
might add to your policy. These may have a broad impact on how you
manage accessibility and will need to be planned with care.

Create a process to track changes in standards that provides you with
sufficient opportunity to respond in good time. Changes in legislation
tend to include dates by which compliance must be achieved. This can be
helpful if you need to gather support, and will usually require involved
planning to ensure that changes are implemented in time.

Standards may change to cover additional areas of accessibility or
respond to new technology. This might require new design and coding
approaches for existing websites. Also review any existing common
libraries, knowledge bases, and training material to ensure that the
current standards are correctly reflected.

Adapt to new technologies {#adapt-to-new-technologies}
-------------------------

Update resources and websites in response to changes in web
technologies.

Consider what technologies you aim to support and ensure that you track
functionality that changes each version. This will include what baseline
browsers and assistive technologies you support and also the authoring
tools that you use, such as your content management system.

### Baseline support list {#baseline-support-list}

Update the list of browsers and assistive technologies that are
supported for website development. New versions will bring new features
and improved support for existing standards. Consider what additional
accessibility support new versions will bring and determine what
additional work might be needed to take advantage of them. Any work can
then be fed into the next iteration of the site.

Similarly, new versions of your authoring tools may provide additional
accessibility features that you can take advantage of. You may need to
update training or provide extra training so that content authors are
able to use new features. Consider suggesting accessibility improvements
back to authoring tool vendors.

### Hardware {#hardware}

Upgrades to hardware are generally less frequent than software changes,
but should also be considered. This includes new consumer devices
intended to access the Web as well as new assistive technologies.
Explore new technology as it becomes commonly available and consider
what changes might be necessary to support accessibility. For assistive
technologies, consider working with advocacy organisations to identify
new technologies and what changes may be necessary to support them.


Incorporate user feedback
-------------------------

Invite user feedback and use it to help guide improvement activities and
identify areas in need of attention.

Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to user
accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support
and also clear escalation paths for issues that cannot be resolved
immediately. Inform the user who raised the issue of any escalation that
requires more involved changes and when improvements might be expected.

Communicate accessibility improvements on your website in the
Accessibility Statement. Make it easy for website users to submit
feedback on accessibility and ensure that any feedback is used when
considering future improvements.
