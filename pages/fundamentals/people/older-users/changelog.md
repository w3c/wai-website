About {#about}
---------------

In some situations, developers are tasked to create Web sites optimized
for older users. Often they are not aware of the relationship between
the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with
disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence of
standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would explain to
them how they could benefit from implementing existing Web accessibility
guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible Web sites for older
users.

### Scenarios {#scenario}

-   Jane DeVeloper has been told to make her website work well for older
    users. This document should show her how to use WCAG as her guide
    for doing so. Jane has a sister Jessica, also a web developer:
  -   Jane needs to design her website for older people; she is not
      aware of accessibility or WCAG
  -   Jessica knows about accessibility and WCAG; she wants to get
      information specifically on designing for older users
-   The web manager at Acme insurance wants to better meet the needs of
    older people as one of their key customer groups. This doc should
    help him integrate the requirements of old people into their ongoing
    accessibility work.
-   Researcher looking to develop guidelines/recommendations for older
    web users. This document should demonstrate how WCAG 2.0 covers the
    accessibility requirements.

### Purpose, Goals, Objectives {#purpose}

Rationale:

-   Many web developers:
  -   do not appreciate the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older
      people
  -   do not know about the accessibility requirements of older users
      with changing abilities
  -   do not understand the importance of the WCAG 2.0 advisory
      techniques
-   Some independent 'senior friendly' guidelines have been developed
    which parallel WAI guidelines, but fragment standardization efforts

Objective:

-   Underline the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older users
-   Provide web developers with information about the importance of WCAG
    2.0 for older users
-   Highlight the relevance of advisory techniques from WCAG 2,
    especially for people who do not use assistive technology
-   Contribute to the harmonization of web accessibility rather the
    development of separate recommendations for older users
-   Catch people focusing on older audience and show that WCAG provides
    what they need (and by the way, make it accessible to everyone while
    you're at it)

### Audience {#audience}

**Primary:**

-   Web developers (including web application programmers, website
    designers, information architects, content writers and editors, etc)
  -   primary group - people developing for older people and unaware
      of WCAG
  -   secondary group - accessibility aware, but looking for older
      people guidance

**Secondary:**

-   Website procurers and commissioners
-   Policy makers
-   Managers & other decision makers
-   Advocates and older peoples' organizations

### Scope {#scope}

Will:

-   Highlight aspects of WCAG 2.0 of particular importance to older
    users with accessibility needs due to ageing
-   Provide tips and best-practices for website development, including
    WCAG 2.0 sufficient & advisory techniques
-   Point to further resources about website development, especially
    those developed through WAI-AGE

Will not:

-   Be a step-by-step guide to accessible development
-   Repeat material already included in other WAI documents (but will
    cross reference them, especially WAI-AGE ones, as appropriate)

Approach {#approach}
---------------------

Initial outline and ideas:

-   **Introduction**
  -   stress overlap of requirements for older users and people with
      disabilities
  -   consider mentioning:
    -   many previous studies made recommendations WRT older people
        that are covered or paralleled by WCAG 2.0
    -   many of the identified requirements for older web users are
        met by advisory techniques
-   **Background**
  -   stress importance of WAI guidelines (refer Lit Review)
    -   mention the importance of the browser and UAAG for people
        who don't use assistive technologies
  -   point to [How People with Disabilities Use the
      Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web.php)
  -   point to [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your
      Organization: Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/)
-   **Requirements / Mapping / @@**
  -   mapping of needs and requirements with WCAG 2.0 drawn from [WAI
      Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature
      Review (draft)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/comparative.html)
      and related documents
    -   probably simplified - maybe by GL/SC and particular
        technique of additional importance
-   **Implementation (tips and best practices)**
  -   mention the importance of content authors, writers, editors, and
      others preparing content in addressing requirements of older
      users
  -   mention importance of authoring tools (include CMS) in achieving
      web accessibility - point to[Selecting and Using Authoring Tools
      for Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software.html)
  -   Mention possibility of utilising
      [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php) (e.g. to make
      sure the user notices small ajax-created page changes/updates)
  -   mention importance of site design and information architecture
      in addressing requirements of older users
  -   reference [BAD](http://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/) as an example
      of good implementation
  -   point to [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier
      Accessibility]({{ "/planning/involving-users/" | relative_url }})
  -   point to [Implementation Plan for Web
      Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/)
  -   point to [Evaluating Web Sites for
      Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html)
  -   point to [Developing Organizational Policies on Web
      Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/pol.html)
  -   point to [Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web
      Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/harmon.html)

-   Outline drafted with headings and points to include

### ** {#backgd}Background from [WAI-AGE Deliverables](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/deliverables.html):** {#background-from-wai-age-deliverables .listintro}

Rationale:
:   This document describes how to use existing Web accessibility
guidelines to create Web sites for older users. It highlights the
relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the
needs of people with disabilities, and guides the readers to more
in-depth resources such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.0, the WAI-AGE Literature Review documents, or other
relevant resources.

Proposal:
:   In some situations, developers are tasked to create Web sites for
older users. Often they are not aware of the relationship between
the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with
disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence
of standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would
explain to them how they could benefit from existing Web
accessibility guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible
Web sites for older users.

Requirements Groupings option {#reqgrping}
-------------------------------------------

A second attempt to organise material by the types of needs older users
have, then show how WCAG 2.0 meets those needs. Trying the approach and
presentation style used in [Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to
Mobile Device Users and People with
Disabilities](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences.html).

Groupings based on [WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a
Literature Review](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/comparative.html) plus
meeting identified impairments. Techniques drawn from [early draft of
Developing Websites for Older People (June
2010)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sites-older-users/Overview-100602.html).
Need to emphasize that any success criteria not listed still need to be
met!

Questions:

1.  Is this 'requirements' approach working? Is the
    organisation/categorisation good? (Too many? Too few?)
2.  Is the level of explanation of each requirement sufficient?
3.  Might it be appropriate to link to the Lit Review for each
    requirement?
4.  How best to include success criteria that don't readily fit into the
    proposed categories?

Presenting the Success Criteria (or Guidelines) within Impairment & Needs Groupings {#issuegrpingorder}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A first attempt to organise material by the types of needs older users
have, then show how WCAG 2.0 meets those needs.

Advantages of this approach:

-   better meets requirements of non-WCAG familiar developer or
    researcher thinking about older people
-   good for people new to accessibility - approaching from a
    design/development perspective
-   de-abstracts WCAG 2.0 some to make it more approachable
-   more educational

Disadvantages of the approach:

-   might reinforce tackling accessibility for just one disability
-   doesn't follow existing WCAG 2.0 structure for those familiar with
    WCAG\
    (note that we *hope* to have different slices/presentations
    integrated in How to Meet Quick Reference at some point)

Groupings might be:

-   **Vision decline / Visual perception** ([example

-   **Hearing decline / Auditory requirements**
-   **Motor control & Dexterity issues** (link size, keyboard use)
-   **Cognitive decline** (memory, concentration, understanding)\

#### [Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv) {#guideline-1.1-text-alternatives .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

Information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever
form best meets the needs of the user. It can also be easily enlarged,
or spoken aloud, so that it is easier for people with reading
disabilities to understand.

##### [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv-all) (A) {#non-text-content-a .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

This success criterion includes addressing CAPTCHAs which can pose a
readability barrier for many, including older people with declining
vision
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)

#### [Guideline 1.2 Time-based Media](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast){.listintro} {#guideline-1.2-time-based-media .listintro}

Older people commonly experience a decline in vision
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
(as well as a significant decline in hearing
[\[02\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whathearing)).
Providing alternatives for video-only and multi-media files through
captioning, transcripts, and/or audio description helps older people
better understand time-based media.

The following success criteria for [Guideline
1.2](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast) will
increase the accessibility of multi-media for older people with
declining vision:

#### [Guideline 1.3 Adaptable](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation) {#guideline-1.3-adaptable .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

This guideline ensures that all information is available in a form that
can be perceived by all users, for example, spoken aloud, or presented
in a different or simpler visual layout.

##### [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-programmatic) (A) {#info-and-relationships-a .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

Older people whose color perception and contrast acuity declines
significantly with older age
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
will benefit from the following technique:

-   [G138: Using semantic markup whenever color cues are
    used](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G138)

Older people experiencing a decline in vision
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
who may use the browser zoom feature or operating system text
enlargement to adapt the page and make it easier to use may benefit from
this success criterion.

##### [1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-understanding) (A) {#sensory-characteristics-a .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

Older people experiencing sensory declines
[\[05\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#what)
and may not see (or hear) well will benefit from this criterion.

#### [Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast) {#guideline-1.4-distinguishable .listintro}

This guideline is concerned with making the default presentation as easy
to perceive as possible to people with disabilities. The primary focus
is on making it easier for users to separate foreground information, be
it visual or audio information, from the background.

##### [1.4.4 - Resize text](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-scale) (AA) {#resize-text-aa .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

This success criterion will increase readability for older people

##### [1.4.9 - Images of Text (No Exception)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation-tech-optional-head) (AAA) {#images-of-text-no-exception-aaa .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

This success criterion increases accessibility for older people
experiencing a decline in vision
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)

##### [1.4.8 - Visual Presentation](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation) (AAA) {#visual-presentation-aaa .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

Older people can experience declining cognitive abilities
[\[07\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
and declining vision
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
making many aspects of the visual presentation of text important for
readability. Readability can be enhanced through techniques such as:

-   [G175: Providing a multi color selection tool on the page for
    foreground and background
    colors](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G175)
-   [G169: Aligning text on only one
    side](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G169)
-   [G188: Providing a button on the page to increase line spaces and
    paragraph
    spaces](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G188)
-   [G146: Using liquid
    layout](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G146) (
    *AND* using measurements that are relative to other measurements in
    the content)
-   Most of the advisory techniques dealing with visual presentation are
    also important for older people, including those dealing with:
  -   Hover - to highlight paragraphs, list items, or table cells
  -   Links - visually distinct links.
  -   Lists - vertical rather than horizontal; expandable bullets;
      show/hide bullet points.
  -   Spacing - line, paragraph and column spacing.
  -   Text - justification; use of proper case; avoiding italics;
      default font size.

#### [Guideline 3.1 Readable](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#meaning) {#guideline-3.1-readable .listintro}

Making websites that are readable and usable by older people with vision
impairments
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
(or declining cognitive abilities
[\[07\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
) can be enhanced by incorporating many of the [advisory techniques
about text
presentation](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/Overview.php#meaning-advisory)
covering issues such as:

-   Writing - using the simplest language appropriate for the content,
    examples, illustrations
-   Text - justification, line length, italics, case
-   Links - visually distinct, in-page links
-   Presentation - pale (non-white) background

#### [Guideline 3.2 Predictable](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#consistent-behavior) {#guideline-3.2-predictable .listintro}

This guideline helps users with disabilities by presenting content in a
predictable order from Web page to Web page and by making the behavior
of functional and interactive components predictable. It is difficult
for some users to form an overview of the Web page. Users with vision or
cognitive limitations, including older users, may become confused if
components appear in different places on different pages.

##### [3.2.5 - Change on Request](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#consistent-behavior-no-extreme-changes-context) (AAA) {#change-on-request-aaa .listintro style="margin-top:0.2em"}

Older people experiencing vision[
[\[03\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)]{.listintro}
(and cognitive
[\[07\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog))
declines, and especially "change blindness"
[\[06\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#elderlyuserscog),
will benefit from this success criterion.

Alternative Success Criteria Rationale Expressions {#altscdesc}
----------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of different ways of expressing the SC rationale - 'meeting
this criterion will ...' vs. putting the impairment and implications
first.

### Option 1: Meeting this SC will ...

##### Sensory Characteristics - [Success Criterion 1.3.3](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-understanding) (A) {#sensory-characteristics---success-criterion-1.3.3-a .listintro}

-   Meeting this criterion will benefit older people [experiencing
    sensory
    declines](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#what)
    who may not see or hear well.

##### Timing adjustable - [Success Criterion 2.2.1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#time-limits-required-behaviors) (A) {#timing-adjustable---success-criterion-2.2.1-a .listintro}

-   Meeting this success criterion will improve usability for older
    people whose [vision
    decline](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
    makes reading difficult, or whose [cognitive
    decline](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
    affects their concentration or short-term memory.

##### On Focus - [Success Criterion 3.2.1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#consistent-behavior-receive-focus) (A) {#on-focus---success-criterion-3.2.1-a .listintro}

-   Meeting this criterion will increase accessibility for older people
    experiencing [declining cognitive
    abilities](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
    or [ [experiencing difficulty with
    forms](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#designforms)]{.listintro}.
-   The advisory techniques will benefit those older people observed to
    experience [difficulties with new browser
    windows](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#existguide),
    for example:
  -   Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window. (future
      link) \[advisory\]

### Option 2: Older people experience X with Y implication, so do Z

##### Sensory Characteristics - [Success Criterion 1.3.3](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-understanding) (A) {#sensory-characteristics---success-criterion-1.3.3-a-1 .listintro}

-   Older people [experiencing sensory
    declines](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#what)
    who may not see or hear well will benefit from this criterion.

##### Timing adjustable - [Success Criterion 2.2.1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#time-limits-required-behaviors) (A) {#timing-adjustable---success-criterion-2.2.1-a-1 .listintro}

-   Many older people experience [vision
    decline](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatvision)
    that can make reading difficult, and might also experience various
    [cognitive
    declines](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
    affecting their concentration or short-term memory. These
    impairments can mean that some older people might need longer to
    read, understand and complete online tasks than others.

##### On Focus - [Success Criterion 3.2.1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#consistent-behavior-receive-focus) (A) {#on-focus---success-criterion-3.2.1-a-1 .listintro}

-   Older people can experience [declining cognitive
    abilities](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#whatcog)
    and [have been observed to sometimes [experience difficulty with
    forms](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#designforms)]{.listintro}
    so using "activate" rather than "focus" as a trigger for changes of
    context and not causing persistent changes of state or value when a
    component receives focus can be helpful.
-   Older people have been observed to experience [difficulties with new
    browser
    windows](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/#existguide),
    so providing advanced warning and only using these when when best
    from an accessibility perspective is good practice.
