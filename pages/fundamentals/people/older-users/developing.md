An extensive [literature review](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wai-age-literature) identified that existing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)) address the accessibility needs of older web users. This page introduces how to use Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to improve the accessibility and usability of websites and web applications for older people.

Please see **[Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/)** for additional background and resources on the overlapping needs of older people and people with disabilities.

## About WCAG 2.0 {#wcag}

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 includes organizing principles and guidelines, and has success criteria at three levels: A, AA, AAA. WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria.

A related document provides techniques that include specific details on meeting the success criteria, such as code examples. WAI encourages developers to use the [How to Meet WCAG 2.0 quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) to access the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques, along with the additional descriptions, examples, and resources from “Understanding WCAG 2.0”.

To learn more about WCAG, see:

- [WCAG Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/) - provides background, an introduction to WCAG, and links to additional information
- [The WCAG 2.0 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20) - describes the different WCAG 2.0 technical and supporting documents
- [How to Meet WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) - is a customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques

## How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People {#map}

This section explains how many of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 guidelines and success criteria specifically meet the needs of older web users. Although not all the WCAG 2.0 success criteria are listed here, WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. Some of the Level AAA success criteria that are particularly important for older people are listed in this section too.

When implementing WCAG 2.0, developers can use different techniques to meet the success criteria. In some cases, using one technique instead of another can optimize accessibility for certain users. This section lists some of the techniques that can help optimize websites for older people. (Many of the techniques link to additional information; those with "(future link)" will be written up with later edits to the WCAG Techniques.)

This section is organized under the four principles of web accessibility from WCAG 2.0: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Success criteria are listed thematically, to help readability. Sometimes they are drawn from different guidelines to address a particular aspect.

### Perceivable information and user interface {#p}

{::nomarkdown}
{% capture boxtitle %}
{:/}

#### Text size {#textsize}

{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Many older people require large text due to declining vision, including text in form fields and other controls.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.4.4 - Resize text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-scale) (AA) says "text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality"

**Example techniques to consider:**

- Using relative font-sizes such as percent ([C12](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C12)) or ems ([C14](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C14)) and ensuring text containers resize ([C28](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C28))
- Providing large fonts by default (future link)
- [C17: Scaling form elements which contain text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C17)
- Avoiding the use of text in raster images (future link)
- [G178: Providing controls on the Web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G178)

More techniques are listed under [1.4.4 - Resize text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-scale) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

**Literature review reference:** [Vision decline with ageing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whatvision).

{% capture boxtitle %}
{:/}
#### Text style and text layout {#textstyle}
{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Text style and its visual presentation impacts how hard or easy it is for people to read, especially older people with declining vision.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.4.8 - Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation) (AAA) includes requirements on text style, text justification, line spacing, line length, and horizontal scrolling

**Example techniques to consider:**

- Avoiding fully-aligned text ([C19](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C19)) or center-aligned text (future link)
- Using readable fonts (future link)
- Using upper and lower case according to the spelling conventions of the text language (future link)
- Avoiding chunks of italic text (future link)
- [G188: Providing a button on the page to increase line spaces and paragraph spaces](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G188)
- Providing sufficient inter-column spacing (future link)
- Avoiding overuse of different styles on individual pages and in sites (future link)

More techniques are listed under [1.4.8 - Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

**Literature review references:** [Vision decline with ageing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whatvision), [Previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ Web guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#existguide), and [Studies of elderly Web users’ specific disabilities - Vision](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#elderlyusersvision).

#### Color and contrast {#color}
{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Most older people's color perception changes, and they lose contrast sensitivity.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.4.1 - Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-without-color) (A) requires that color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element
- [1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast) (AA) requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for the visual presentation of text and images
- [1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast7) (AAA) requires a higher contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for the visual presentation of text and images

**Example techniques to consider:**

- [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18)
- [G14: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G14)
- Using a light pastel background rather than a white background behind black text to create sufficient but not extreme contrast (future link)
- [G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on focus for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G183)

More techniques are listed under [1.4.1 - Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-without-color), [1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast) and [1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast7) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

**Literature review references:** [Vision decline with ageing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whatvision), and [Studies of elderly Web users’ specific disabilities: vision](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#elderlyusersvision).

Because many older people's hearing or vision declines, they often need transcripts, captions, and low background sound.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv-av-only-alt) (A)
- [1.2.2 - Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-media-equiv-captions) (A)
- [1.2.3 - Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded video)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv-audio-desc) (A)
- [1.2.4 - Captions (Live)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-media-equiv-real-time-captions) (A)
- [1.2.5 - Audio Description (Prerecorded video)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv-audio-desc-only) (AA)
- [1.2.7 - Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded video)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv-extended-ad) (AAA)
- [1.2.8 - Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv-text-doc) (AAA)
- [1.2.9 - Audio-only (Live)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-media-equiv-live-audio-only) (AAA)
- [1.4.7 - Low or No Background Audio (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-noaudio) (AAA)

**Example techniques to consider:**

- All transcript, caption, and audio description techniques from the listed success criteria should be considered as appropriate, for example:
  -   [G69: Providing an alternative for time based   media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G69)
  -   [G158: Providing an alternative for time-based media for   audio-only content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G158)

  -   [G93: Providing open (always visible)   captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G93)
  -   [G173: Providing a version of a movie with audio   descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G173)
- [G56: Mixing audio files so that non-speech sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the speech audio content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G56)

More techniques are listed under the success criteria for [Guideline 1.2 (Time-based Media)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv) and under [1.4.7 - Low or No Background Audio (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-noaudio) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

**Literature review references:** [Vision decline with ageing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whatvision) and [Hearing loss with age](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whathearing).

#### Text-to-speech (speech synthesis) {#speech}
{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Some older people use text-to-speech (speech synthesis) software, which is becoming increasingly available in browsers and operating systems.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv-all) (A) says "a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose" is required
- [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-programmatic) (A) says "information, structure, and relationships" to be made available, for example to text-to-speech software

**Example techniques to consider:**

- [G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G94)
- [H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44)
- [H42: Using h1-h6 to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42)

More techniques are listed under [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv-all) and [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation-programmatic) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

#### CAPTCHA {#captcha}
{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Older people with declining eyesight may not be able to discern the characters in a CAPTCHA, especially because CAPTCHAs often have low contrast and do not increase in size when users have text sized larger.

CAPTCHA stands for 'Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart'. An example of CAPTCHA is:<br>![the letters 'c a p t c h a' are difficult to read because they are skewed and on a complex background]({{ "/content-images/older-users/captcha.png" | relative_url }})

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv-all) (A) includes a requirement for alternative CAPTCHAs

**Example techniques to consider:**

- [G143: Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G143) *AND* [G144: Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G144)
- Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs (future link)
- Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA (future link)
- Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users (future link)

**Literature review reference:** [Vision decline with ageing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/#whatvision).

{% capture boxtitle %}
{:/}
#### Links {#links}
{::nomarkdown}
{% endcapture %}
{% include box.html type="start" title=boxtitle class="large" %}
{:/}

Many older people need links to be particularly clear and identifiable due to declining vision and cognition.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-refs) (A) requires that the purpose of a link can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text together with its surrounding context
- [2.4.9 - Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-link) (AAA) says "a mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone"
- [2.4.7 - Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible) (AA) requires a visible keyboard focus indicator that shows what component on the web page has focus

**Example techniques to consider:**

- [G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G91)
- Limiting the number of links per page (future link)
- Making links visually distinct (future link)
- [G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G195)
- Highlighting a link or control when the mouse hovers over it, or when it receives keyboard focus (future links)

More techniques are listed under [2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-refs), [2.4.9 - Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-link), and [2.4.7 - Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible) in "How to Meet WCAG 2.0".

Many older people need navigation to be particularly clear due to declining cognitive abilities.

**WCAG 2.0 success criteria:**

- [2.4.5 - Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc) (AA) says "more than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages"
- [2.4.8 - Location](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-location) (AAA) says "information about the user's location within a set of Web pages is available"
- [2.4.2 - Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms-title) (A) says "web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose" (this is important for search results as the page title is usually displayed first in the listing)

**Example techniques to consider:**

- [G63: Providing a site map](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G63)
- [G161: Providing a search function to help users find content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G161)
