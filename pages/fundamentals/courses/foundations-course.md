The "**[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)**" online course provides **the foundation you need to make your digital technology accessible**, so that it:

*   works well for people with disabilities
*   meets international standards
*   enhances the user experience for everyone
*   achieves goals

Accessibility is essential to create high-quality apps, websites, and other digital content &mdash; and to not exclude people from using your products and services.

## Duration

<blockquote class="pull alt-1 right" style="font-size:0.875rem!important">
<p>It’s easy to follow and complete. You can do it over several sessions at your own pace.</p>
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/YULaiLai/status/1331577142640058368">Laiya Lee <span lang="zh">李荔雅</span><br>The nerdy gurl next door</a></cite>
</blockquote>

The course is designed to take about **16-20 hours to complete** for most people. It is listed as 4 weeks of 4-5 hours effort per week.

It is **self-paced** so you can complete it in a shorter or longer time frame.

This course will be available on the edX platform through at least June 2025. We expect a version of this course to be available long term.

## Cost: Free, optional certificate

**The course is free.** The audit option gives you access to all of the content.

{% include image.html src="courses/certificate.png" alt="" class="normal right" %}

Optionally, you can choose to get a **Verified Certificate** for $99 USD to demonstrate successful course completion.

The Certificate can be printed, listed in resumes, and linked to from online profiles.

**Transcript:**

Shadi: I'm Shadi Abou-Zahra, Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

Natalia: I'm Natalia Amelina, Senior National Project Officer in Education at the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

Shadi: Join us in this course to learn the fundamental skills and key resources that are becoming increasingly important across digital professions.

Natalia: In according with statistics, people with disabilities can make up around 15% of the population -- and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information as a human right. And you may know that this Convention was ratified by 180 countries all over the world, very likely including your country too.

Shadi: In this course you will learn how people with disabilities use the web including different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

Natalia: You will also learn how web accessibility improves user experience of older people, people using mobile devices, and essentially for everyone.

Shadi: And, of course, you'll also learn all about the international standards from W3C -- and training materials and learn first steps in creating accessible web content.

Natalia: This course was designed for technical and non-technical people. If you work with digital technologies this course is ideal for you to get started.
