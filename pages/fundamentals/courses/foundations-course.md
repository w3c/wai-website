The "**[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)**" online course provides **the foundation you need to make your digital technology accessible**, so that it:

*   works well for people with disabilities
*   meets international standards
*   enhances the user experience for everyone
*   achieves goals

Accessibility is essential to create high-quality apps, websites, and other digital content &mdash; and to not exclude people from using your products and services.

## Duration

<blockquote class="pull alt-1 right" style="font-size:0.875rem!important">
<p>It’s easy to follow and complete. You can do it over several sessions at your own pace.</p>
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/YULaiLai/status/1331577142640058368">Laiya Lee <span lang="zh">李荔雅</span><br>The nerdy gurl next door</a></cite>
</blockquote>

The course is designed to take about **16-20 hours to complete** for most people. It is listed as 4 weeks of 4-5 hours effort per week.

It is **self-paced** so you can complete it in a shorter or longer time frame.

This course will be available on the edX platform through at least June 2025. We expect a version of this course to be available long term.

## Cost: Free, optional certificate

**The course is free.** The audit option gives you access to all of the content.

{% include image.html src="courses/certificate.png" alt="" class="normal right" %}

Optionally, you can choose to get a **Verified Certificate** for $99 USD to demonstrate successful course completion.

The Certificate can be printed, listed in resumes, and linked to from online profiles.

You can start auditing the course now, and later choose to get a Verified Certificate.

**Transcript:**

Shadi: I'm Shadi Abou-Zahra, Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

Natalia: I'm Natalia Amelina, Senior National Project Officer in Education at the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

Shadi: Join us in this course to learn the fundamental skills and key resources that are becoming increasingly important across digital professions.

Natalia: In according with statistics, people with disabilities can make up around 15% of the population -- and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information as a human right. And you may know that this Convention was ratified by 180 countries all over the world, very likely including your country too.

Shadi: In this course you will learn how people with disabilities use the web including different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

Natalia: You will also learn how web accessibility improves user experience of older people, people using mobile devices, and essentially for everyone.

Shadi: And, of course, you'll also learn all about the international standards from W3C -- and training materials and learn first steps in creating accessible web content.

Natalia: This course was designed for technical and non-technical people. If you work with digital technologies this course is ideal for you to get started.
