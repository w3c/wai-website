  - `/about/participating/` instead of `/get-involved/`

  - `/courses/foundations-course/` instead of `https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/foundations-course/`
- In ["For More Information" section](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#more-info), use double brackets around "Digital Accessibility Foundations - Free Online Course", to automatically use the title of the linked-to resource as link text.
- Update frontmatter for translators.
