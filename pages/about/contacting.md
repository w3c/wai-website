## Press inquiries

For press inquiries regarding **accessibility or the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)**, email [shawn@w3.org, w3t-pr@w3.org, wai@w3.org](mailto:shawn@w3.org,w3t-pr@w3.org,wai@w3.org?subject=press%20request-accessibility)

## Technical, implementation, and other support questions

### WAI website

Many questions are addressed in documents on the WAI website.
* A good starting place to find relevant resources is the [Accessibility Fundamentals Overview listing page](/fundamentals/) and [Introduction to Web Accessibility](/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).
* For information on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), see the [WCAG 2 Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
* For an annotated list of all WAI educational and technical support documents covering a wide range of topics, see **[[WAI Resources]](/resources/)**.

### Mailing list for accessibility questions

WAI hosts a WAI Interest Group (IG) mailing list for discussion of digital accessibility issues and questions. The list is open for anyone to read, submit, and respond to it. If you have a question that might be relevant to the WAI IG list, you can:

-   Search the [WAI IG mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) to see the topic has already been addressed sufficiently
-   Read the [Mailing Lists](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist) section of the WAI IG page for guidance on contributing to a comfortable, constructive exchange of ideas; <br>then [Subscribe to the Discussion List](/about/groups/waiig/#subscribing-and-unsubscribing-to-the-discussion-list) and post appropriate questions

## Feedback on specific documents

You can submit comments on specific documents through GitHub or email:

-   For WAI web pages under <code>w3.org/WAI/</code> &mdash; the links are in the 'Help improve this page' box near the bottom of the page.
-   For WCAG, other standards, and technical reports under <code>w3.org/TR/</code> &mdash; the links are either in the 'Status of This Document' section, or under the 'More details about this doc' section near the top of the page, after 'Feedback'.

If you cannot determine where to send comments on a specific document, email <a href="mailto:wai@w3.org?body=%5Binclude%20a%20relevant%20email%20Subject%5D%0A%0A%5Bput%20comment%20here...%5D%0A%0AI%20give%20permission%20to%20share%20this%20to%20a%20publicly-archived%20email%20list.">wai@w3.org</a> with the document name in the subject line and the permission to send your email to a publicly-archived email list. We will forward your message to the appropriate place.

## Feedback on the WAI website design

You can submit comments on the overall WAI website (www.w3.org/) either to a W3C WAI staff list or to a public list:
-   <team-site-design@w3.org> (seen by WAI staff only, not public)
-   <wai-site-comments@w3.org> (seen by WAI staff and the public)
