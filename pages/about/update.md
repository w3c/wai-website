## Introduction

We hope you'll find accessibility work on this page that you are interested in contributing to through W3C WAI. After each item is the acronym of the responsible Working Group (WG) and some Task Forces (TF). Information about the groups is later in this page &mdash; first, let's look at some of the work itself.

## Current Work Highlights

### Updating Core Guidelines and Other Standards

* **W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3** is in an exploratory phase, and will change substantially. It's years away from being finalized. Please see information on the latest draft and [review questions](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/#for-your-review) in [[WCAG 3 Introduction]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/) _[AG WG]_

* **ARIA 1.3** &mdash; We're working on additional support for Braille and other [new features for ARIA 1.3](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#substantive-changes-targeted-for-the-1-3-release).  _[ARIA WG]_

### Developing New Standards

* **WAI-Adapt** enables users to adapt (or ‘personalize’) how content is presented to meet their needs and preferences. [[WAI-Adapt Overview]](/adapt/) _[APA WG, WAI-Adapt TF]_

* **Spoken Presentation** technical standards will enable screen readers and voice assistants to pronounce words correctly. [[Pronunciation Overview]](/pronunciation/) _[APA WG, Spoken Presentation TF]_

### Documenting Additional Guidance for People with Cognitive Disabilities, Low Vision, and Mobile Devices

* **Cognitive Accessibility** &mdash; We're updating several documents to better address the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities. A current topic is mental health. [[Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]](/cognitive/). _[AG WG, COGA TF]_

<!--
* **Low Vision Accessibility** &mdash; We're writing guidance that goes beyond the minimums required by WCAG. It is called "supplemental guidance". Current topics cover proximity, printing, and alternative themes such as high contrast and dark mode. _[AG WG, Low Vision TF]_ -->

* **Mobile Accessibility** work includes supporting on-going standards development, including supporting WCAG 3 exploration. [[Mobile Accessibility at W3C]](/standards-guidelines/mobile/) _[AG WG, Mobile TF]_

### Updating Guidance on Applying WCAG to ICT and on EPUB Accessibility

* **WCAG2ICT** describes how Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 can be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). In October 2024 we published an update that includes all WCAG 2.2Level A and AA success criteria. We are now working on Level AAA success criteria. [[WCAG2ICT Overview]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/) _[AG WG, WCAG2ICT TF]_

* **EPUB Fixed Layout Accessibility** aims to help publishers address challenges for people with cognitive disabilities and low vision. [EPUB Fixed Layout Accessibility Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/) _[EPUB3 WG, FXL A11y TF]_

### Defining User Requirements (AUR) and Exploring Emerging Technologies

Documenting the user needs of people with disabilities helps develop standards to meet those needs. It also helps designers, developers, and others better understand and meet user needs in order to support accessibility. <cite>XR Accessibility User Requirements</cite> and more listed at [Digital Accessibility User Requirements](/research/user-requirements/). 

<!--
* **Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements ("NAUR")** is a Working Draft. A natural language interface is a user interface in which the user and the system communicate via a natural (human) language. The user provides input as sentences via speech or other input, and the system generates responses as sentences delivered by speech, text, or another modality. [About NAUR](https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/10/natural-language-interface-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/), [NAUR Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/naur/)  _[APA WG, Research TF]_
-->

* **Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements ("CTAUR")** is a Working Draft. It describes user needs in tools that provide support for one or more specific collaborative features. These features include real-time editing of content by multiple authors, the use of comments or annotations, and revision control. [CTAUR Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/ctaur/)  _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **How People with Disabilities Use the Web** helps you understand user needs broadly. We've updated this resource and published new videos to go along with it. We are making minor revisions to the user stories. [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/).

### Testing Accessibility, Evaluation Tools

* **Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility** helps you start to assess the accessibility of a web page. We are polishing up a new iteration of this popular resource. [Easy Checks - previous version](/test-evaluate/preliminary/), [draft new version of Easy Checks](/test-evaluate/easy-checks/)
* **ACT Rules** (Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT), also known as "WCAG 2 Test Rules") describe ways to test conformance to WCAG success criteria. They are primarily for developers of evaluation tools and test methodologies. We're documenting more. [[About WCAG 2 Test Rules]](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) _[AG WG, ACT TF]_
* ACT Rules implementation reports list how test tools or methodologies address test examples in ACT Rules. We invite evaluation tool developers to [submit implementation reports](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/implementations/reporting/). _[AG WG, ACT TF]_

### Translating Resources

Existing translations of W3C accessibility resources are listed in [All WAI Translations](/translations/). We are currently working with volunteer translators to translate more resources and update existing translations, including translations of WCAG and of educational resources. See [WCAG 2 Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/) and [Translating WAI resources](/about/translating/).

## Upcoming Publications

We plan to publish the following documents in 2024 or early 2025. <!-- To learn about "Candidate Recommendation" (**CR**), "Proposed Recommendation" (**PR**), "Recommendation", and other stages, see [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process: **Milestones** and Opportunities to Contribute](/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/). --> 

* W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 as an updated Working Draft, see [WCAG 3 Introduction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/)
* [Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/ctaur/) as a completed Note
* More [WAI Translations](/translations/) - usually some each week

Recent publications and other announcements are listed on the **[News page](/news/)**.

### Get Updated

To get news via e-mail, LinkedIn, Mastodon, or Atom/RSS feed when these and other accessibility documents are _ready for review_ or _published as final_, see **[[Get WAI News]](/news/subscribe/)**.

## Wait, Wait, There's More

This page _only lists about half_ of the active work on accessibility at W3C. Much of the work happens in the accessibility groups that are introduced in the [W3C Working Groups page](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/#wg-list).

### Surprise! We already have a resource for that

Did you know the WAI website has: **videos, tips, tutorials, tools** (for generating reports and accessibility statements), **translations** (over 35 languages), **training** (a free online course), and so much more. There are [resources for](/roles/) content authors, designers, developers, evaluators, testers, managers, policy makers, trainers, educators, web users, advocates, and people with disabilities.

**Discover** accessibility resources that _you didn't even know existed_ from the annotated list of **[[WAI Resources]](/resources/).** When you find helpful information, would you **share it with others**.

## How to Get Involved {#participate}
