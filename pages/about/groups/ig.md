## Charter

The WAI Interest Group is chartered until July 2027.

To learn about the group’s scope, participants and deliverables, see the [WAI Interest Group’s Charter](https://www.w3.org/2025/05/wai-ig-charter).

## Participate in digital accessibility discussions

W3C and the WAI Interest Group welcome input on W3C’s digital accessibility work from the global accessibility community.

The WAI Interest Group is open to the public with no minimum requirements for participation in the group.

The group provides frequent opportunities for you to give input on digital accessibility work at W3C:

* **Comment on WAI publications:** During development, the group publishes working drafts of [WAI working groups](/about/groups/)’ deliverables, with options for public comment &mdash; these are announced on the WAI Interest Group mailing lists.
* **Contribute to digital accessibility discussions:** Contribute your views to the WAI Interest Group’s mailing list discussions.


## WAI Interest Group mailing lists {#mailinglist}

The WAI Interest Group has two mailing lists with public archives:
1. **Announcements list (public-wai-announce)**  &mdash; for WAI announcements only. [Announcements archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/)
2. **Discussion list (w3c-wai-ig)** &mdash; for public discussion and WAI announcements. [Discussion archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/)
   * If you are subscribed to the Discussion list, you will also get emails sent to the Announcements list, so you don't need to subscribe to both lists.
   * If you want to send messages to the Discussion list, you must subscribe to it.

### Announcements list

* To **subscribe** to the Announcements list, send an email with the subject [‘Subscribe’ to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org](mailto:public-wai-announce-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe).
* To unsubscribe, send an email with the subject [‘Unsubscribe’ to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org](mailto:public-wai-announce-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe).

### Discussion list

* To **subscribe** to the Discussion list, send an email with the subject [‘Subscribe’ to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org](mailto:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe).
* To unsubscribe from the list, send an email with the subject [‘Unsubscribe’ to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org](mailto:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe).

#### Contributing to positive discussions

Email messages should **contribute to a comfortable, constructive exchange** of ideas to advance digital accessibility. Before you send an email, please think about how it will come across to the people around the world who are on the list and everyone who can read your publicly-archived message.
-   **Be respectful.** Be positive. Be open to different perspectives.
-   **Provide constructive information.** Focus on developing potential solutions, rather than just complaining.
-   Focus on ideas, not participants. Avoid personal attacks, naming calling, and such.
-   Explain the issue clearly. Provide sufficient background information.

See additional guidance in W3C's Code of Conduct: **[Positive Work Environment at W3C: Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/)**.

#### Sending messages to the Discussion list

Make sure your message is related to digital accessibility and is appropriate for the WAI Interest Group.
-  No soliciting. You may send messages about public conferences. You may not advertise products or services. 
-  If you are not sure whether or not a message is appropriate for the WAI IG list, please send a draft message to WAI staff at [wai@w3.org](mailto:wai@w3.org?subject=WAI-IG-message-draft).
-  If you have a question about the WAI IG mailing list itself, please don't send it to the list — instead, send it to WAI staff at [wai@w3.org](mailto:wai@w3.org?subject=WAI-IG-list).
- **If your message is asking about vendors or products**, include the following wording in your message:<br>
"Please reply to me directly and not to the whole list, so that specific vendor or product information is not discussed on the list."

To send a message to the Discussion list:
- First subscribe to the list (instructions above).
- Then send your message from your subscribed email address to [w3c-wai-ig@w3.org](mailto:w3c-wai-ig@w3.org).
   - Use a Subject that describes the topic clearly. 

The first time you send a message to a public W3C mailing list, you will get a reply email asking if you will give permission for your message to be distributed to the list and thus go into the public archive. There is an option to do this once and then you don't have to do it again in the future.

**Replying to messages:**
-   When your comments are not useful for the entire list, please **reply off-list** — that is, reply directly to the sender and do not send your message to the list.
-   If you change topics, change the Subject. This is usually handled as follows:<br>
    `New Topic XYZ [was: Old Topic]`
-   Keep your reply comments near the top of your message, and only quote essential parts of a previous message at the top — so there are few quote markings for readers to wade through. Include the full text of the messages that you are replying to below your reply so that readers can easily get the context from previous messages.
