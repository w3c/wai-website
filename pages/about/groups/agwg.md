## Current Work

The Working Group maintains a comprehensive list of [publications and current timelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Timelines).

The [Project Plan](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Timelines) details intended timeline and milestones for this work. A [list of publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/tr-groups-all#tr_Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines_Working_Group) on the W3C Technical Reports page includes completed deliverables that are no longer worked on by the Working Group.

### WCAG 3

Work on W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3 takes place in many task forces and subgroups of the Working Group. Information about projects and timelines is available on the [WCAG 3 Project Plan](https://github.com/w3c/silver/wiki).

### WCAG 2.2

The Working Group is processing comments from wide review and preparing for Candidate Recommendation. Current work is shown in [WCAG issues](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/).

### Task Forces

The AG WG uses [task forces](task-forces) to focus work on specific projects in addition to the work above. Task Forces are described on the related page. Some task forces form sub-groups to further divide the work.
