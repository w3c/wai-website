## Mission

The mission of the AG Working Group is to develop and maintain specifications for making web content accessible to people with disabilities, along with support materials for implementing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

To learn about the group’s focus, scope and deliverables, see the [AG Working Group Charter](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/charters/).


## Current work 

For details of the current work, see the [AG Working Group wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Main_Page).

### WCAG 3

Work on developing WCAG 3 takes place in many task forces and subgroups of the AG Working Group. For information about the WCAG 3 timelines and publication plan, see [WCAG 3 Timeline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_3_Timeline).

### WCAG 2.2

The [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/) maintains WCAG 2.x (WCAG versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2) for the AG Working Group. This includes reviewing public comments on WCAG 2.x and improving the following supporting documents:

* [Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/)
* [Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/)

For current outstanding WCAG 2.x issues, see [WCAG issues &mdash; GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/).

## Contribute to the work

W3C and the AG Working Group welcome input on WCAG work from the global accessibility community.

### Contribute without joining the group

There are ways you can contribute without being a member of the working group:

* **Comment on publications:** During development, the group publishes working drafts for public comment &mdash; these are announced on the [WAI News pages](/news/) and on the [WAI Interest Group mailing lists](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist).
* **Raise, comment on, or propose fixes to WCAG issues:** If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published WCAG 2.x resources, W3C welcomes you to [raise a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/) &mdash; you can also comment on and, even better, propose solutions for existing issues.
* **Contribute to WCAG 3 discussions:** As WCAG 3 develops, many topics are being discussed &mdash; to contribute your views, see the list of [open WCAG 3 discussions in GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/wcag3/discussions) and [mailing list discussions](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/).
* **Participate in a community group:** W3C hosts a small number of active community groups that focus on digital accessibility issues &mdash; for details, search for ‘accessibility’ on [Current Groups &mdash; W3C Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/).

### Become a participant in the group

Joining the AG Working Group enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the group in the following ways:

* Engage actively with other participants in the working group using the group’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).
