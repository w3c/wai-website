The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)’s working groups develop digital accessibility guidelines and related materials &mdash; the working groups are supported by task forces that operate under them, and contributions from accessibility discussions in the WAI Interest Group.

## Accessibility Guidelines Working Group

The mission of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/) and its task forces is to develop and maintain specifications for making web content accessible to people with disabilities, along with support materials for implementing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

The AG Working Group is supported by the:

 - [Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/)
 - [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/)
 - [Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/low-vision-a11y-tf/)
 - [Mobile Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/matf/)
 - [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/)
 - [WCAG2ICT Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/)

## Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group

The mission of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/) and its task forces is to ensure W3C specifications support accessibility for people with disabilities through the following activities: reviewing specifications; developing new specifications and technical support materials; collaborating with other W3C working groups on technology accessibility; and coordinating harmonized accessibility strategies within W3C that include security, privacy, and internationalization.

The APA Working Group is supported by the:

 - [Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/fast/)
 - [Maturity Model Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/)
 - [Research Questions Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/research-questions/)
 - [Spoken Presentation Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pronunciation/)
 - [WAI-Adapt Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/adapt/)

## ARIA Working Group

The mission of the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/) and its task forces is to enhance the accessibility of web content through developing supplemental attributes that can be applied to native host language interactive elements and exposed via platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs).

The ARIA Working Group is supported by the:

 - [Authoring Practices Guide Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/)
 - [Portable Document Format Accessibility APIs Mapping Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/)

## WAI Interest Group

The [WAI Interest Group](/about/groups/waiig/) is a public forum with mailing lists for sharing information and exchanging ideas about W3C’s digital accessibility work.
