WAI has Working Groups developing accessibility guidelines and related
work, and Interest Groups providing a forum for discussing Web
accessibility issues. **[Participating in WAI](/get-involved/)**
describes generally how to participate in WAI work. To find out more
about participating in a specific WAI group, see the group's home page
linked below. WAI working groups often have Task Forces operating under
them; see Task Force link below.

[Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/) *(formerly WCAG WG)*
: AG WG develops guidelines to make web content accessible for people
with disabilities, and develops implementation support materials for
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

[Accessible Platform Architectures (APA)](/about/groups/apawg/)
: APA reviews specifications, develops technical support materials,
collaborates with other Working Groups on technology accessibility,
and coordinates harmonized accessibility strategies within W3C.

[Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](/about/groups/ariawg/)
: ARIA develops the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
suite of technologies and other technical specifications when needed
