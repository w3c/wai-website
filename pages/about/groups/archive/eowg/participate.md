## Commenting on EOWG Resources {#comment}

**We especially encourage contributions on resources-in-progress and open issues.** You are welcome to comment on other EOWG resources. It might some time for us to address comments on inactive resources.
- To find out about resources-in-progress and open issues, see:
   -  **[Work for this Week]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/EOWG_Meetings#Work_for_this_week)**.
   - EOWG mailing list messages.
   - EOWG surveys. (You can see the results of surveys, although not access the surveys themselves. To see the results, add “/results” to the end of the URL.)
- We prefer comments in GitHub. You can comment on existing issues; open new issues; fork and edit, and submit pull requests; etc. Links to GitHub are at the bottom of each resource page.
   - Alternatively, you can send comments to the EOWG mailing list. You need to subscribe to the list _(instructions below)_ before sending messages.

   - If you are _not_ affiliated with a W3C Member, your public W3C account will be set up.
   - If you are affiliated with a W3C Member, it may take some time to get confirmation of your member account access from your organization's W3C Representative.

## Becoming an Active Participant {#participant}

Participant status requires you to commitment to support the work of the group. Active participants are expected to contribute at least 4 hours per week towards the Working Group. Editors are expected to contribute at least 8 hours per week.

Active participants are expected to contribute to the development of deliverables by:
-   attending most of the Working Group teleconferences that are in reasonable working hours in your time zone.
-   being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group, including minutes of past meetings.
-   commenting on open issues.
-   responding to e-mails sent to the EOWG mailing list.
-   completing [EOWG surveys/questionnaires](http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/all) in a timely manner.

With permission of the Chairs, an individual may contribute only to a specific deliverable, and thus only needs to meet the participation expectations related to that deliverable.
