The mission of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group (ARIA WG) is to enhance the accessibility of web content through the development of supplemental attributes, including roles, states, and other properties, that can be applied to native host language elements and exposed via platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs).

## Charter

The group is chartered until January 2027.

To learn about the group’s focus, scope and deliverables, see the [ARIA Working Group Charter](https://www.w3.org/2025/01/aria-charter).

## Current work 

For details of the current work, see the [ARIA Working Group wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/wiki/). (This doesn't seem to be maintained - should we link to a GitHub page?)

Are we keeping the following 'Roadmap', Deliverables and Status' (out of date?), and 'Work flow' child pages? Should we move any of that information to this section or just continue to link to it? Should we turn the list items below into headings with a brief description (as we did for WCAG current work on the AG WG page)?

The Working Group has established a [road map](roadmap) for upcoming work. This road map is executed via [publications and status](deliverables), which include:

- WAI-ARIA 1.3,
- WAI-ARIA modules for Digital Publishing and Graphics,
- Accessibility API Mappings for ARIA, Digital Publishing, HTML, and SVG, and
- WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices.

The [ARIA Project Plan](/about/groups/ariawg/planning/) details intended timeline and milestones for this work and proceeds according to the [ARIA Working Group Work Flow](/about/groups/ariawg/workflow/).

## Contribute to the work

W3C and the ARIA Working Group welcome input on ARIA work from the global accessibility community.

### Contribute without joining the group

There are many ways you can contribute without being a member of the working group:

* **Comment on publications:** During development, the group publishes working drafts for public comment &mdash; these are announced on the [WAI News pages](/news/) and on the [WAI Interest Group mailing lists](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist).
* **Raise, comment on, or propose fixes to ARIA issues:** If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published ARIA resources, W3C welcomes you to raise a new issue on GitHub, or you can also comment on and, even better, propose solutions for existing issues &mdash; see the list of [repositories maintained by the ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/contribute/#github-issues-and-pull-requests).
* **Contribute to ARIA discussions:** You may contribute your views to the ARIA Working Group's [mailing list discussions](/about/groups/ariawg/contribute/#mailing-list-discussions).
* **Participate in a community group:** W3C hosts a small number of active community groups that focus on digital accessibility issues &mdash; for details, search for ‘accessibility’ on [Current Groups &mdash; W3C Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups).

### Become a participant in the group

Joining the ARIA Working Group enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the group in the following ways:

* Engage actively with other participants in the working group using the group’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

See [Instructions for joining the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/instructions/).
