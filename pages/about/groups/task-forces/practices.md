## Objectives

The objective of the APG Task Force is to develop the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide, which describes considerations that might not be evident to authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone, and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [APG Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/work-statement/).

## Current work

The APG Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/).

For details of the current work, see the following: 
* [APG Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki)
* [APG milestones](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/milestones)
* [APG projects](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/projects)

## Contribute to the work

The APG Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [APG GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published APG resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open APG issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the APG Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the APG Task Force, you must first be a member of the ARIA Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the ARIA Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the APG Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/aria-practices/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the ARIA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
