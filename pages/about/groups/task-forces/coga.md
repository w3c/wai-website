## Objectives

The objective of the COGA Task Force is to develop guidance and techniques for content authoring and user agent implementation in order to make web content accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [COGA Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/work-statement/).

## Current work

The COGA Task Force supports the deliverables of two W3C working groups:

* [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
* [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/)

For details of the current work, see the [COGA Task Force wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki).

## Contribute to the work

The COGA Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on cognitive and learning accessibility work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [COGA GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/coga/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published COGA resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open COGA issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the COGA Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the COGA Task Force, you must first be a member of one of the working groups the task force supports:
* AG Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/)
* APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/)

Once you are a member of either the AG or APA working groups, email the [W3C staff contact for the COGA Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/cognitive-a11y-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the AG or APA working groups’ task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
