The WCAG2ICT Task Force is a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/). It assists this Working Group with the work identified below.

## Status

This work statement was approved by the AG Chairs WG on 24 January 2025. The task force is active.

The work statement describes the WCAG2ICT Phase 1 objectives that have been completed and the updated Phase 2 objectives for the WCAG2ICT Note.

NOTE: This work is mentioned in the [Other Deliverables section of the current AG WG Charter.](https://www.w3.org/2023/11/ag-charter#ig-other-deliverables) The continuation of the work is also included in the [current AG WG Charter](https://www.w3.org/2023/11/ag-charter). The WCAG2ICT Task Force plans that future AG WG charters include further maintenance of this important guidance.

## Objective

The objective of the WCAG2ICT Task Force is to develop documentation describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).

The WCAG2ICT Phase 1 objectives have been completed by incorporating guidance for WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 guidelines, Level A and AA success criteria, and their associated glossary definitions. Phase 1 of WCAG2ICT also added new content that identifies WCAG success criteria that are problematic when applied to some non-Web ICT. The 2024 [Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/) was published as a result. 

This work statement sets further objectives for Phase 2 of the WCAG2ICT Note updates as there have been concerns with determining which success criteria can (or should) apply for a particular technology as well as the possibility of suggesting normative language changes to some success criteria to make them more directly applicable in non-web contexts (See the scope of work section for further details and explanation). 

In addition, the task force would like to develop content to address misunderstandings of what the WCAG2ICT Note does and does not provide which we hope will address incorrect assumptions and provide an explanation of problems that the WCAG2ICT Note does not solve. How this content will be delivered (as a separate document, web page, or within the WCAG2ICT Note) will be determined once the key content has been developed.

## Scope of Work

The work of the task force includes:

*   Determining how to apply each of the new WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 (hereafter called “WCAG 2.x") guidelines and Levels A, AA, and AAA success criteria to non-Web ICT; this includes provision of additional details for application to closed product software and where applying individual criteria might be difficult and why; and
*   Producing an updated Working Group Note (a form of W3C Technical Report)—following the W3C process under the coordination, review, and approval of the AG WG—that describes:
    *   how each of the new WCAG 2.x A and AA success criteria could apply to non-Web ICT (completed in Phase 1)
    *   how each of the new WCAG 2.x guidelines could apply to non-Web ICT (completed in Phase 1)
    *   clarification of challenges of applying particular WCAG 2.x success criteria to non-web ICT, including closed product software (completed in Phase 1)
    *   address challenges in issues. [See closed issues addressed in Phase 1](https://github.com/w3c/wcag2ict/issues/?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) (completed in Phase 1)
    *   provide a concise, high-level overview or introduction to WCAG2ICT, explaining its purpose and how to use it
    *   where known, give examples of some Success Criteria which may not be applicable to a particular non-web technology
    *   as needed, suggested changes to success criteria normative language to more clearly align with non-web software and document technologies
    *   how each of the WCAG 2.x Level AAA success criteria could apply to non-web technologies

NOTE: "suggested changes to success criteria" would not be suggestions to change WCAG itself, but instead to provide language more meaningful in non-web contexts. For example, in criteria where the WCAG normative language uses CSS pixels, the Task Force could provide alternative language more appropriate for non-web technologies.

Explicitly out of scope for the WCAG2ICT Task Force work are:

*   proposing changes to WCAG 2.x
*   developing techniques or interpretations of WCAG 2.x for implementing WCAG 2.x in Web technologies
*   developing any specific, sufficient techniques, including platform-specific techniques, for implementing WCAG 2.x in non-Web ICT, though examples may be in scope
*   determining whether WCAG, as a whole, _should be_ applied to non-web content
*   developing a normative standard or any normative requirements

## Approach

WCAG2ICT is a Task Force of the AG WG, which has oversight over the Task Force to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG 2.x. The AG WG decision process applies within the group. Draft content is periodically taken to the AG WG for review as it progresses.

The primary effort of this Task Force is to describe how to interpret WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, success criteria and conformance requirements when applying them to non-web ICT; and evaluating what WCAG Conformance means in the context of non-Web ICT. The resulting Working Group Note will include a discussion of the application of each of the criteria in WCAG 2.x to non-Web ICT, including their interface components and platforms, and the extent to which [WCAG Conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#conformance) is meaningful to non-Web ICT.

To efficiently develop the Working Group Note, work is sometimes broken down into sub-groups, under the coordination of the Task Force facilitators following established AG WG procedures for sub-groups.

The work has been focused in stages to ensure WCAG2ICT content was made available in time for use in upcoming updates to regulations and standards (like the EN 301 549) that apply WCAG to non-web technology. Phase 1 prioritized Level A and AA criteria and known issues in the existing Note and was published on 4 November 2024. The next update to WCAG2ICT plans to address the remaining in-scope items detailed in the [Scope of Work](#scope-of-work) section.

The work is carried out through a series of document drafts, all publicly visible, with opportunities for public comment. In particular, key stakeholders such as developers, evaluators, accessibility experts, researchers, procurement experts, and end users will be regularly involved in the development process. Key participants will be drawn from people with expertise not only in Web technologies, but also those with specific accessibility expertise, including the development of accessible frameworks, platforms, user interface components, and software covering a broad variety of computing environments.

## Timeline

The following sections contain rough timelines for the WCAG2ICT work. Actual timelines and project management are handled outside of this work statement, and will not be maintained herein.

A phased delivery of the WCAG2ICT Working Group Note was necessary to provide timely guidance for upcoming regulatory and standards updates, and Phase 1 has concluded.

### Phase 1 (completed)

    *   develop a brief requirements document (as inclurporated into the work statement) and obtain agreement from AG WG
*   Plan: October 2022 - April 2023, Actual: October 2022 - August 2023 
    *   develop an initial draft with updates to the Working Group Note
    *   develop initial discussion drafts of remaining sections of the Note
    *   develop initial discussion drafts of Note sections
    *   start reporting to the AG WG (schedule and frequency aligned to when groups of SCs are added)
*   Plan: July - June 2023, Actual: August 2023 - July 2024
    *   incorporate first feedback from TF and AG WG into a (publicly visible) Editors’ Draft

    *   process feedback on document, further develop and edit WG Note
    *   publish updated formal draft, process comments
*   Plan: November 2023, Actual: October 2024 (with editorial revision November 2024)
    *   Publish updated WCAG2ICT Note

### Phase 2

The next phase of updates will include the remaining in-scope work listed in the [Scope of Work](#scope-of-work) section.
