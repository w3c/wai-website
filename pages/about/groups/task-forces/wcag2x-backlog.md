## Objectives

The WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force:

- maintains up-to-date versions of the normative and informative materials associated with versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 (2.x) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and
- documents considerations for WCAG 3.0 that cannot be readily addressed within the existing normative language of the WCAG 2.x specification.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/work-statement/).

## Current work

The WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/).

For details of the current work, see the [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki).

The task force has developed a [workflow process](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki/WCAG-2-Task-Force-process) for:

* creating and vetting pull requests for WCAG 2.x issues, and
* creating responses to WCAG 2.x issues. 

The process includes a two-week review of all changes by the AG Working Group.

## Contribute to the work

The WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the work to resolve WCAG 2.x issues.
