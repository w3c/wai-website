## Objectives

The objectives of the WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force are to maintain up-to-date versions of the normative and informative materials associated with versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 (2.x) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG); and to document considerations for WCAG 3.0 that cannot be readily addressed within the existing normative language of the WCAG 2.x specification.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/work-statement/).


## Current work

The WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/).

For details of the current work, see the [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki).

The task force has developed a [workflow process](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki/WCAG-2-Task-Force-process) for:

* creating and vetting pull requests for WCAG 2.x issues, and
* creating responses to WCAG 2.x issues. 

The process includes a two-week review of all changes by the AG Working Group.

## Contribute to the work

The WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the work to resolve WCAG 2.x issues.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force by commenting on or proposing solutions for open issues in the [WCAG GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues).

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force, you must first be a member of the AG Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the AG Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/wcag2x-backlog/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force. 

**Note:** As a participant in one of the AG Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
