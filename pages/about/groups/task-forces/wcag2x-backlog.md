## Announcements and Meetings

No announcements at the moment.

## Approach
The WCAG2 TF is a Task Force of the AG WG, which has oversight over the Task Force to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG 2.x. The AG WG decision process applies within the group. We have an AG WG co-chair liaison to ensure draft content is taken to the AG WG for review as it progresses.

The WCAG 2 TF has developed a [workflow process](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki/WCAG-2-Task-Force-process) for both creating and vetting pull requests and creating responses to issues. The process also includes a two-week review of all changes by the AG WG.

## Communication
The communications of the WCAG 2 Task Force are publicly visible. Communication mechanisms include:

* [Publicly archived mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wcag2-issues/);
* Public [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/) and [Wiki](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki) spaces;
* Public minutes (on the wiki and email list);
* Regular updates to the AGWG via the [AGWG email list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/);

## Participation
To join this WCAG 2 Task Force, individuals must be participants of AG WG. Participants are expected to actively contribute to the work of the task force, including:
