The [Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force (ACT TF)](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/) is a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/). It assists this Working Group with the work identified below.

## Status

This Work Statement was proposed to AG WG on xx xx 2024 and will be active if approved. The prior [2020 work statement](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/work-statement-2020work-statement-2020) is available. The [Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/) contains information about the operation and resources of this group.

Objective
---------

ACT TF's objective is to evolve and maintain a repository of ACT Rules for [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 (WCAG 2)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), as well as for other W3C specifications, including [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/), to promote a unified interpretation among different web accessibility test tools and methodologies. ACT Rules conform to the [ACT Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/) to document different testing practices. ACT TF reviews ACT Rules, and present them to AG WG when they meet stringent quality criteria. AG WG may publish such ACT Rules as non-normative W3C resources, as part of the supplemental guidance for WCAG 2.

## Scope of Work

The work of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force includes:

*   **Repository of ACT Rules:** Review ACT Rules contributed to W3C, such as from [Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Community Group (ACT-R CG)](https://act-rules.github.io/), and maintain a repository of rules approved by W3C Working Groups, including AG and ARIA
*   **Implementations Monitoring:** Encourage and gather implementation reports from accessibility test tools and methodologies for ACT Rules published by AG WG
*   **Specification Maintenance:** Maintain [Errata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/errata) for [ACT Rules Format 1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/), and gather feature requests for future versions of this specification
*   **Silver Collaboration:** Coordinate with [AG WG](/about/groups/agwg/) and its [Silver Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/silver/) to exchange ideas for conformance testing and to integrate ACT in future guidelines
*   **ACT Community Support:** Promote the work of ACT within W3C and externally, and encourage participation and contribution by different key stakeholders

## Approach

This work builds on the earlier work carried out by ACT TF and on the work that continues to be carried out by the [ACT-R CG](https://act-rules.github.io/). In particular, ACT Rules development continues to take place in ACT-R CG with oversight by the Task Force. This is to maximize participation and leverage contribution by the broader community, while ensuring close coordination and harmonization with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

ACT TF will update the ACT rules Format to version 1.1

ACT TF will continue to gather implementation experience, including of the [ACT Rules Format 1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/), [Common Input Aspects note](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/), [Evaluation and Report Language (EARL)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/earl/), and related W3C guidance. ACT TF may update or develop additional non-normative guidance, for example to help explain ACT and its uses.

The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force depends on:

*   [AG WG](/about/groups/agwg/) to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG requirements;
*   [ARIA WG](/about/groups/aria/) to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WAI-ARIA requirements;
*   [ACT Rules Community Group](https://act-rules.github.io/) to utilize this group's contribution on conformance testing.

The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force will also coordinate with relevant W3C groups and activities on testing and quality assurance. This may include groups such as [Browser Testing and Tools Working Group](https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/). The Task Force may also coordinate with the [Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](/about/groups/eo/) where necessary to improve the writing, presentation, and educational value of the developed materials.

## Communication

The communications of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force are publicly visible. Communication mechanisms include:

*   Up-to-date task force homepage;
*   Publicly archived mailing list;
*   Public GitHub and Wiki spaces;
*   Public group surveys and minutes;
*   Regular updates to the AG WG;
*   Scheduled deliverable reviews.

## Participation

To join this Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force, individuals must be participants of AG WG. Participants are expected to actively contribute to the work of the task force, including:

*   Minimum 4 hours per week of task force work (this time also counts towards the individual's participation requirement in the AG WG);
*   Remain current on the task force mailing list and respond in a timely manner to postings;
*   Participate regularly in task force telephone meetings, or send regrets ahead of time.

Participants may also join Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force sub-groups. Sub-groups take on specific assignments for the Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force.

If you are interested in becoming a participant of the Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force or have any questions regarding its work, contact the task force facilitators.
