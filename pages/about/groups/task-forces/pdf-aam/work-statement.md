The Portable Document Format Accessibility APIs Mapping (PDF-AAM) Task Force is a task force of the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/). It assists this Working Group to map Accessibility APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to PDFs and keep the development of [PDF-AAM](https://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/) in sync with WAI-ARIA.'

## Status

The PDF-AAM Task Force Work Statement was [approved on 12 November 2024](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/2070) and is now active. The [PDF-AAM Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/) contains information about the operation and resources of the group.

## Objective

The mission of the PDF-AAM Task Force is to specify how user agents should map accessibility semantics within the Portable Document Format specification. This Task Force provides a focused forum for this work while the Working Group continues its work on ARIA development.

## Scope of Work

The PDF-AAM Task Force will produce a W3C Technical Report on [PDF Accessibility API Mappings](https://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/), specifying accessibility API mappings for PDF, based on the [Core-AAM](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.2/) and [HTML-AAM](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) specifications.

## Approach

The [PDF/UA Processor Liaison Working Group (LWG)](https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-ua-processor-lwg/) is a meeting place for the PDF and assistive technology industries to help drive the formalization of common understandings on processing PDF files that conform to [ISO 14289 (PDF/UA)](https://www.iso.org/standard/64599.html), the standard for accessible PDF documents. The PDF-AAM will incorporate and extend existing work developed by the PDF/UA Processor LWG into a W3C Technical Report, which is expected to reach the Recommendation Track according to the [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/).

## Communication

PDF-AAM Task Force communications and discussions are visible to the public. The [PDF-AAM Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/) details communication mechanisms in use. The Task Force will:

- support synchronous (e.g., teleconferences, face-to-face meetings) and asynchronous (e.g., mailing list discussions, issue trackers, wiki, surveys) methods of communication;
- use the procedures of the [ARIA Working Group Decision Policy](/about/groups/ariawg/decision-policy/) to make decisions;
- provide updates and feedback to ARIA Working Group teleconferences, as appropriate â€” these liaisons are primarily the responsibility of the PDF-AAM Task Force facilitators;
- maintain information resulting from its activities (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) on the [PDF-AAM Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/).

## Participation

Any participant in the ARIA Working Group may participate in the PDF-AAM Task Force. Participants should expect to dedicate 2 to 4 hours per week for PDF-AAM Task Force work, which is considered part of the overall work commitment to the ARIA Working Group. This work includes:

- remaining current on the PDF-AAM Task Force mailing list and responding to postings in a timely manner;
- providing feedback to editors of specifications via email or by filing bugs;
- participating in PDF-AAM Task Force teleconferences, or sending regrets to the PDF-AAM Task Force mailing list.

If you are interested in becoming a participant of the PDF-AAM Task Force or have any questions regarding its work, contact the Task Force facilitators.

## Facilitation

The PDF-AAM Task Force facilitators set the meeting agendas, lead the meetings, determine consensus, and are the primary liaison between the Task Force and the ARIA Working Group.

The W3C Staff Contact for the ARIA Working Group and its task forces oversees attention to W3C Process with respect to the chartered requirements of the ARIA Working Group.

## Patent Policy

This Task Force is part of the [ARIA Working Group Charter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/charter), which operates under the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20200915/) (15 September 2020 Version). W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the [ARIA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83726/status).
