## Objectives

The WAI-Adapt Task Force develops normative specifications and best practices guidance to support enhanced and personalized web content delivery that better meets the diverse requirements of people with disabilities. It does this by making fuller use of underused features already specified in HTML, and by proposing new markup elements and attributes, as needed.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [WAI-Adapt Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/adapt/work-statement/).

## Current work

The WAI-Adapt Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [WAI-Adapt Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/wiki).

For more information on the WAI-Adapt work, see:

* [WAI-Adapt Overview](/adapt/) &mdash; an overview of W3C’s WAI-Adapt technique
* [WAI-Adapt video {% include_cached external.html %}](https://ln.sync.com/dl/04f8c9330/) &mdash; a technical demonstration of a semantic overlay approach that enables user-driven personalization, employing user-preferred symbols for text that has had WAI-Adapt semantics added to it

## Contribute to the work

The WAI-Adapt Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the work to enable content and interface personalization for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force:

- **Draft WAI-Adapt resources:** Review and provide feedback on drafts that are still being developed.
- **Open WAI-Adapt issues:** Comment on or propose solutions for open issues.
- **Published WAI-Adapt resources:** Let us know if there is a new issue with any of these.

Comment or raise a new issue in the [WAI-Adapt GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/issues) or [email the task force](mailto:public-adapt@w3.org) (**Note:** This email will go to a publicly archived mailing list).

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the WAI-Adapt Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the WAI-Adapt Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the WAI-Adapt Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/personalization-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
