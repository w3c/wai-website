The objective of the Maturity Model (MM) Task Force is to help organizations build capacity to develop and maintain accessible products and services by crafting an Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) with an assessment tool that incorporates W3C standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and other related guidance, such as Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA).

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [MM Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/work-statement/).

## Current work

The MM Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [MM Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/wiki). (Nothing here. Is there another document in GitHub we should link to instead?)

## Contribute to the work

The MM Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the Accessibility Maturity Model work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [Maturity Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published Accessibility Maturity Model resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open Maturity Model issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the MM Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the MM Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email [who?] to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
