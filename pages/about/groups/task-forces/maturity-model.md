## Objectives

The objective of the Maturity Model (MM) Task Force is to provide an Accessibility Maturity Model to guide organizations in developing the capability to buy, build or use accessible internal and external products and services, and to help them track changes and trends in providing these products and services over time.


## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [MM Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/work-statement/).

## Current work

The MM Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [Maturity Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/).

## Contribute to the work

The MM Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the Accessibility Maturity Model work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [Maturity Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published Accessibility Maturity Model resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open Maturity Model issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the MM Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the MM Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the Maturity Model Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/maturity/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
