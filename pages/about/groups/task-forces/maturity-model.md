## Objectives

The Maturity Model Task Force provides an Accessibility Maturity Model to guide organizations in developing the capability to:

- buy, build or use accessible internal and external digital assets, products and services, and
- track changes and trends in providing these assets, products and services over time.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [Maturity Model Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/work-statement/).

## Current work

The Maturity Model Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [Maturity Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/).

## Contribute to the work

The Maturity Model Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the Accessibility Maturity Model work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force:

- **Draft Accessibility Maturity Model resources:** Review and provide feedback on drafts that are still being developed.
- **Open Accessibility Maturity Model issues:** Comment on or propose solutions for open issues.
- **Published Accessibility Maturity Model resources:** Let us know if there is a new issue with any of these.

Comment or raise a new issue in the [Maturity Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/maturity-model/issues) or [email the task force](mailto:public-maturity@w3.org) (**Note:** This email will go to a publicly archived mailing list).

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the Maturity Model Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Maturity Model Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the Maturity Model Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/maturity/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
