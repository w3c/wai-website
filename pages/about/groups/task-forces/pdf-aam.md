The Portable Document Format Accessibility APIs Mapping (PDF-AAM) Task Force is a task force of the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/). It assists this Working Group to map Accessibility APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to PDFs and keep the development of [PDF-AAM](https://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/) in sync with WAI-ARIA.'

Some information on this page is also shown on, and may be more current in, the [PDF-AAM page](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/pdf-aam/).

## Objective

The mission of the PDF-AAM Task Force is to specify how user agents should map accessibility semantics within the Portable Document Format specification. This Task Force provides a focused forum for this work while the Working Group continues its work on ARIA development.

### Work Statement

The [PDF-AAM Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/work-statement/) defines the initial objective, scope, approach, and participation of the Task Force.

## Meetings and Communication

The PDF-AAM Task Force conducts its work using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous tools.

- Teleconferences of the ARIA Working Group and its task forces
- Face-to-face meetings
- [Mailing lists](#mailing-lists)
- IRC (Internet Relay Chat) discussion on the [#pdf-aam](irc://irc.w3.org/pdf-aam) IRC channel, used largely for minute-taking
- [PDF-AAM source repository issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/pdf-aam/issues)
- [ARIA specifications repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria)
- [Web-Based Surveys (WBS)](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/159734/)

### Teleconferences

The PDF-AAM Task Force meets the third Wednesday of the month, 1:00–1:30 PM Eastern Time. For more details, including the meeting time in local time zones, see [PDF-AAM Calendar](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/pdf-aam/calendar).

### Meeting Minutes

[Minutes from previous meetings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/task-forces/pdf-aam/minutes) are available.

### Mailing Lists

The PDF-AAM Task Force uses the following mailing list for email discussion: [public-pdf-aam@w3.org Mail Archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pdf-aam/). 

Participants are automatically added to the mailing list when they become a participant of the Task Force.

## Current Work

As this work develops, the [Editor’s Draft](https://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/) will be updated with the latest PDF Accessibility API mappings.

## Publications

The PDF-AAM Task Force is primarily developing [PDF Accessibility API Mappings](https://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/).
