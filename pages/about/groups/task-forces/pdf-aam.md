## Objectives 

The PDF-AAM Task Force specifies how user agents should map accessibility semantics within the Portable Document Format specification.

## Work Statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [PDF-AAM Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/work-statement/).

## Current Work

The PDF-AAM Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [PDF-AAM GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/pdf-aam).

## Contribute to the work

The PDF-AAM Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the PDF-AAM module.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force:

- **Draft PDF-AAM resources:** Review and provide feedback on drafts that are still being developed.
- **Open PDF-AAM issues:** Comment on or propose solutions for open issues.
- **Published PDF-AAM resources** Let us know if there is a new issue with any of these.

Comment or raise a new issue in the [PDF-AAM GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/pdf-aam/issues) or [email the task force](mailto:public-pdf-aam@w3.org) (**Note:** This email will go to a publicly archived mailing list).

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the PDF-AAM Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the PDF-AAM Task Force, you must first be a member of the ARIA Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the ARIA Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the PDF-AAM Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/pdf-aam/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the ARIA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
