## Objectives

The Mobile Accessibility Task Force:

- produces resources for how to apply the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to mobile, and 
- makes sure mobile apps are considered in new accessibility guidelines.

Mobile includes, but is not limited to, native mobile apps, mobile web apps, and hybrid apps that use web components inside native mobile apps.

## Contribute to the work

The Mobile Accessibility Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the mobile accessibility work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force:

- **Draft mobile accessibility resources:** Review and provide feedback on drafts that are still being developed.
- **Open mobile accessibility issues:** Comment on or propose solutions for open issues.
- **Published mobile accessibility resources:** Let us know if there is a new issue with any of these.

Either comment / raise a new issue in the [Mobile Accessibility GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/matf/issues) or email the [chair](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/mobile-a11y-tf/participants/#chairs).

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Mobile Accessibility Task Force, you must first be a member of the AG Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the AG Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the Mobile Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/mobile-a11y-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.
