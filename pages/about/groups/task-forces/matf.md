## Objectives

The Mobile Accessibility Task Force:

- produces resources for how to apply the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to mobile, and 
- makes sure mobile apps are considered in new accessibility guidelines.

Mobile includes, but is not limited to, native mobile apps, mobile web apps, and hybrid apps that use web components inside native mobile apps.
