## Objectives

The objectives of the Mobile A11y Task Force are to produce resources for how to apply the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to mobile — including, but not limited to, native mobile apps; mobile web apps; mobile web content; and hybrid apps that use web components inside native mobile apps — and to make sure mobile apps are considered in new accessibility guidelines.

## Work statement

The Mobile A11y Task Force has regrouped in 2024 and a new Work Statement will be published soon.

## Current work

The Mobile A11y Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/).

For details of the current work, see the [Mobile A11y Task Force GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/matf/issues).

## Contribute to the work

The Mobile A11y Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on mobile accessibility work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [Mobile A11y GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published mobile accessibility resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open mobile accessibility issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the Mobile A11y Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Mobile A11y Task Force, you must first be a member of the AG Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the AG Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the Mobile A11y Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/mobile-a11y-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the AG Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
