## Objectives

The Research Questions Task Force:

- identifies accessibility barriers and knowledge gaps in emerging and future web technologies,
- publishes research findings to help ameliorate those barriers and gaps, and
- supports W3C’s horizontal reviews of web technologies.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [Research Questions Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/research-questions/work-statement/).

## Current work

The Research Questions Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see the [Research Questions Task Force wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/research-questions/wiki/Main_Page).

## Contribute to the work

The Research Questions Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the emerging and future web technologies research work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force by commenting on or proposing solutions for open issues.

Comment or raise a new issue in the [Research Questions GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/rqtf/issues) or [email the task force](mailto:public-rqtf@w3.org) (**Note:** This email will go to a publicly archived mailing list).

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the Research Questions Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Research Questions Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the Research Questions Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/rqtf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
