## Announcements

No announcements at the moment.

## Meetings and Communication

The CSS A11Y TF conducts its work using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous tools. Most work is done via email and issues as shown below, supplemented by occasional teleconferences.

- Most work is conducted via the [css-a11y issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/css-a11y/issues);
- [Email lists](/about/groups/task-forces/css-a11y/#mailing-lists), used largely for administrative matters;
- IRC discussion on the [#css-a11y](irc://irc.w3.org/css-a11y) IRCchannel, used largely for minute-taking;
- [Web-Based Surveys (WBS)](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/94039/);
- Teleconferences when needed (also see [meeting minutes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/css-a11y/minutes));
- Face to face meetings when needed, primarily at the annual Technical Plenary;
- GitHub resources, currently in one repository but potentially later in others:
    - [CSS-A11y main source repository](https://github.com/w3c/css-a11y/);
    - [Wiki](https://github.com/w3c/css-a11y/wiki);
    - [Separate repository for CSS Accessibility API Mappings deliverable](https://github.com/w3c/css-aam/).

These tools are used by participants of the Task Force. For ways non-participants can contribute, see [how to contribute to the Working Group and file comments](/about/groups/apawg/contribute/).

### Teleconferences

Teleconference details will be announced when a time is selected.

### Meeting Minutes

[Minutes from previous meetings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/css-a11y/minutes) are available.

### Mailing Lists

The CSS A11Y TF uses the public-css-a11y@w3.org mailing list ([mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-a11y/)) for email discussion. Participants are automatically added to the mailing list when they become a participant of the Task Force. Non-subscribers may post, but you must join the task force to subscribe to the list.
