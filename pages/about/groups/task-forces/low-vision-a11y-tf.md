## Objectives

The objective of the LV Task Force is to address web accessibility issues that are specific to people with low vision through inputting into WCAG 2 techniques and understanding documents; inputting into WCAG 3; and developing additional low-vision guidance resources.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [Low Vision Accessibility Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/low-vision-a11y-tf/work-statement/).

## Current work
