The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.x Task Force (WCAG 2 TF) is a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/). It assists this Working Group with the work identified below.

## Status

This work statement is a draft yet to be approved. The task force is active.

NOTE: This work is mentioned in the [Other Deliverables section of the current AG WG Charter.](https://www.w3.org/2019/12/ag-charter#ig-other-deliverables) The continuation of the work is also included in the [current AG WG Charter](https://www.w3.org/2023/11/ag-charter).

* Ongoing updates of non-normative resources to understand and implement guidance, including the current [Understanding WCAG 2.x](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/) and [Techniques for WCAG 2.x](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/) as well as new resources to support implementation of the new standard.
* Errata for WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.

## Objective

The objective of the WCAG 2 Task Force is to maintain up-to-date versions of the normative and informative materials associated with versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, and to document considerations for WCAG 3.0 which cannot be readily addressed within the existing normative language of the 2.x specification. 

## Scope of Work

The work of the WCAG 2 TF includes:

* Monitoring and responding to issues opened against the [WCAG github](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues) repository;
* Drafting and vetting recommended changes to the existing WCAG documents, in the form of pull requests and other documentation;
* Promoting the ongoing relevance of WCAG 2, and encouraging participation and contribution by different key stakeholders.

Explicitly out of scope for the WCAG 2 TF is:
* developing a new normative standard or any new normative requirements, beyond suggesting changes to correct 2.x normative language.

## Approach

The WCAG2 TF is a Task Force of the AG WG, which has oversight over the Task Force to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG 2.x. The AG WG decision process applies within the group. We have an AG WG co-chair liaison to ensure draft content is taken to the AG WG for review as it progresses.

The WCAG 2 TF has developed a [workflow process](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki/WCAG-2-Task-Force-process) for both creating and vetting pull requests and creating responses to issues. The process also includes a two-week review of all changes by the AG WG.

## Communication
