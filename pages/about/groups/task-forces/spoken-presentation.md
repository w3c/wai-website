## Objectives

The Spoken Presentation Task Force develops normative specifications and guidance for author-controlled pronunciation across environments, including assistive technology (AT), as opposed to relying on platform heuristics.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope, and deliverables of the task force, see the [Spoken Presentation Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/spoken-presentation/work-statement/).

## Current work

The Spoken Presentation Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see:

* [Spoken Presentation Task Force current work](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/blob/master/README.md)
* [Spoken Presentation Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/wiki/)

For more information on the spoken presentation work, see:

* [Pronunciation overview](/pronunciation/) &mdash; an overview of W3C’s pronunciation technique
* [Pronunciation video {% include_cached external.html %}](https://ln.sync.com/dl/10e1a9c60/92faztk9-he4wbve6-twt5jp3h-zuh6brfd) &mdash; a technical demonstration of approaches for controlling pronunciation in spans of web content where uniform markup can make a difference

## Contribute to the work

The Spoken Presentation Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the pronunciation work.
