## Objectives

The objective of the Spoken Presentation Task Force is to develop normative specifications and best practice guidance on providing proper pronunciation for HTML content across operating systems, so that words are pronounced correctly when using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and users’ preferred assistive technologies.

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [Spoken Presentation Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/spoken-presentation/work-statement/).

## Overview of the spoken presentation work

* [Pronunciation overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/) &mdash; an overview of W3C’s pronunciation technique
* [Pronunciation video {% include_cached external.html %}](https://ln.sync.com/dl/10e1a9c60/92faztk9-he4wbve6-twt5jp3h-zuh6brfd) &mdash; a technical demonstration of approaches for controlling pronunciation in spans of web content where uniform markup can make a difference

## Current work

The Spoken Presentation Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/).

For details of the current work, see:

* [Spoken Presentation Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/wiki/)
* [Spoken Presentation Task Force current work](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/blob/master/README.md)

## Contribute to the work

The Spoken Presentation Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the pronunciation work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [Pronunciation GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published Spoken Presentation resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open pronunciation issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the Spoken Presentation Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Spoken Presentation Task Force, you must first be a member of the APA Working Group &mdash; see [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the APA Working Group, email the [W3C staff contact for the Spoken Presentation Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/pronunciation-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the APA Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
