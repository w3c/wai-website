## Contribute to the work

The WCAG2ICT Task Force welcomes input from individuals and organizations around the world on the work to update accessibility guidelines to include non-web documents and software.

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force:

- **Draft WCAG2ICT resources:** Review and provide feedback on drafts that are still being developed.
- **Open WCAG2ICT issues:** Comment on or propose solutions for open issues.
- **Published WCAG2ICT resources:** Let us know if there is a new issue with any of these.

Comment or raise a new issue in the [WCAG2ICT GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag2ict/issues) or [email the task force](mailto:public-wcag2ict-tf@w3.org) (**Note:** This email will go to a publicly archived mailing list).

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
