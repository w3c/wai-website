## Objectives

The objective of the WCAG2ICT Task Force is to develop documentation describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).

## Work statement

To learn about the focus, scope and deliverables of the task force, see the [WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement/).


## Current work

The WCAG2ICT Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/).

For details of the current work, see the [WCAG2ICT Task Force wiki](https://github.com/w3c/wcag2ict/wiki).

## Contribute to the work

The WCAG2ICT Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on the work to update accessibility guidelines to include non-web documents and software.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [WCAG2ICT GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag2ict/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published WCAG2ICT resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open WCAG2ICT issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the WCAG2ICT Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the WCAG2ICT Task Force, you must first be a member of the AG Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the AG Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the WCAG2ICT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/wcag2ict/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the AG Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
