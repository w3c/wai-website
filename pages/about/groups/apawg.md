## Mission

The mission of the APA Working Group is to ensure W3C specifications support accessibility for people with disabilities through the following activities: reviewing specifications; developing new specifications and technical support materials; collaborating with other W3C working groups on technology accessibility; and coordinating harmonized accessibility strategies within W3C that include security, privacy, and internationalization.

## Charter

To learn about the group’s focus, scope and deliverables, see the [APA Working Group Charter](https://www.w3.org/2023/07/apa-wg-charter).

## Current work

For details of the current work, see the [APA Working Group wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/).

## Contribute to the work

W3C and the APA Working Group welcome input on APA work from the global accessibility community.

### Contribute without joining the group

There are ways you can contribute without being a member of the working group:

* **Comment on publications:** During development, the group publishes working drafts for public comment &mdash; these are announced on the [WAI News pages](/news/) and on the [WAI Interest Group mailing lists](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist).
* **Raise, comment on, or propose fixes to APA issues:** If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published APA resources, W3C welcomes you to [raise a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/apa/issues) &mdash; you can also comment on and, even better, propose solutions for existing issues.
* **Contribute to APA discussions:** You may contribute your views to the APA Working Group's [mailing list discussions](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa/).

### Become a participant in the group

Joining the APA Working Group enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the group in the following ways:

* Engage actively with other participants in the working group using the group’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

See [Instructions for joining the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/instructions/).
