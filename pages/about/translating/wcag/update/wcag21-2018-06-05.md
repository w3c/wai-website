## Refer to the relevant process

To update a W3C technical report translation, you must follow the same process as for an initial translation:
- Unofficial translations: [Instructions for W3C technical reports translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#how)
- Authorized translations: [Policy for Authorized W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy.html)

Considering the limited scope of this update, we will do our best to ensure that the W3C's steps run as smoothly as possible.

## Browse the content changes

The easiest way to spot the changes between the two versions is to use a "diff checker" tool, such as the [W3C HTML Diff service](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff). 

Use the following input values :

Address of reference document
: [https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/)

Address of new document
: [https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-WCAG21-20230921/](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-WCAG21-20230921/)

You can use this direct link: [Diff between 2018 and 2023 WCAG 2.1 versions, via W3C HTML diff service](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff?doc1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2F2018%2FREC-WCAG21-20180605%2F&doc2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2F2023%2FREC-WCAG21-20230921%2F)

We also recommend that you read the [WCAG 2.1 Change log](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#changelog).

## Update the translation

[How to translate WCAG 2](/about/translating/wcag/) explains how to use the content in [`w3c/wcag` {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/) repository to translate WCAG. Refer to the [`WCAG21-20230921` tag](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/tree/WCAG21-20230921) to get the files of the 21 September 2023 version.

If using this recent method is overly complex to you, you can update your existing files.

## Authorized translations: update the translation header

Please update the following information in the translation header (also called "disclaimer") at the top of the document.

## Check your translation thoroughly

Please properly check your files before submission to W3C. 

In particular, make sure that:

- HTML is valid. You can use [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS is valid. You can use [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- All `id`s are in English; that is, they have not been translated. 
  - If you have followed [How to Translate WCAG 2 – Get the source files](/about/translating/wcag/#get-source-files), this should be fine.
  - If you have translated WCAG 2 before January 2024, you might want to check this.
- `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes of the `<html>` tag are correct
- `lang` attribute has been used when relevant (especially when some text has been kept in English)
- The links/anchors of the original and translated versions match.
- “Jump to table of contents”, “Collapse sidebar” and “Hide sidebar” have been translated.
- There is no code showing in the rendered page.
- No custom CSS has been added.
- (Authorized translation) An errata has been created and is hosted on the Lead Translation Organization (LTO)'s website.
