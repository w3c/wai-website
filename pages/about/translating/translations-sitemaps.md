## Overview

**A translation sitemap allows volunteer translators to [browse the list of WAI resources](#browse) for which translations are welcome, and [volunteer to translate it](#volunteer).**

We currently have [{{ site.translations-sitemaps.size }} translations sitemaps](#list).

_If you are a new volunteer_, please [send us an e-mail to express your interest](/about/translating/resources/#intent) first.

## List of Translations Sitemaps {#list}

_Languages are listed alphabetically by their English names._

{::nomarkdown}
<ul>
  {% for sitemap in site.translations-sitemaps %}
    {% assign langname=site.data.lang[sitemap.tlang].name %}
    {% assign langnativename=site.data.lang[sitemap.tlang].nativeName %}
    <li><a href="{{ sitemap.permalink | relative_url }}"><span lang="sitemap.tlang" style="text-transform: capitalize;">{{ langnativename }}</span> ({{ langname }})</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Note" class="simple" %}
{:/}

Translations sitemaps are generated for languages with an active volunteer community.\
If you are an active volunteer and wish to use this feature, feel free to contact us at [group-wai-translations@w3.org](mailto:group-wai-translations@w3.org).

## How to use a translation sitemap {#how-to-use}

### Browse the list {#browse}

- _Priorities_ section only lists [priority resources](/about/translating/resources/#priorities) identified by the WAI team.
- _Sitemap_ section lists all WAI resources for which translations are welcome, grouped by top-level pages.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Note" class="simple" %}
{:/}

Some WAI Resources are not listed in Translations Sitemaps. That may be because a resource will be updated soon, is not intented for translation, or is far from ready to be translated. The list is regularly updated.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

For each resource listed, you can see:
- The name and URL of the resource (in English), in the "WAI Resource" column: ;
- The status of the translation, in the "Translation Status" column:
  - <p>{% include_cached icon.html name="check-circle" %} Up-to-date. A URL points to the translation.</p>
  - <p>{%- include_cached icon.html name="warning" -%} Translation needs update. We welcome a volunteer translation update.</p>
  - <p>{% include_cached icon.html name="ex-circle" %} No translation. We welcome a volunteer translation.</p>

### Volunteer to translate a page or to update a translation {#volunteer}

If a resource has not been translated in this language, or if a translation needs update, a link is displayed in the "Translation status" column. For example, "Volunteer to translate this page".

Clicking on this link allows you to declare your intent, by pre-filling a GitHub issue in the [wai-translations repository {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-translations/).

**After submitting your intent, please always wait for a reply from WAI team**. We will check that the file is not currently being translated by someone else, and that it is not about to be updated.
