## Initial step: Declare your intent

In accordance with the WAI Translations process, please always [declare your intent](/about/translating/resources/#intent) and wait for reply from WAI team _before_ starting a translation.

## Create the translation file

<ol>
   <li>
   Near the bottom of each page on the WAI website, there is a "Help improve this page" box.<br />
   The middle button is "Fork & Edit in GitHub". That gets you to the GitHub repository.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".fork-edit-link" %}
   <figure class="fork-edit-link screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/fork-edit-link.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the ‚ÄúHelp improve this page‚Äù box. The ‚ÄúFork & Edit in Github‚Äù middle button is outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li>
   From there, you will be asked to ‚ÄúFork the repository‚Äù ‚Äì that is, creating a copy of the repository so you can make changes without affecting the original one.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".fork-repo" %}
   <figure class="fork-repo screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/fork-repo.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a page in GitHub, stating ‚ÄúYou need to fork this repository to propose changes‚Äù. The ‚ÄúFork this repository‚Äù button is outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li>
   On the next screen, select all the original file code and copy it to your clipboard (<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></kbd>).
   </li>
   <li>
   Click on the expand icon, next to the editor breadcrumb, to show the repository file tree.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".expand-file-tree" %}
   <figure class="expand-file-tree screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/expand-file-tree.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the edit view in GitHub: the Expand icon, next to the secondary breadcrumb, is outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li>
   Click on the "+" or "Add file" button to create a new file.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".new-file" %}
   <figure class="new-file screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/new-file.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the edit view in GitHub, with the file tree expanded. The ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd file‚Äù button is outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li>Name the new file according to instructions on <a href="/WAI/about/translating/resources/technical-steps/#create-file">Creating a New Translation</a> page.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".name-new-file" %}

   </figure>
   </li>
   <li>
   <p>Paste the original content that you copied in step 2 into the editor (<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd></kbd>).</p>
   <p>&#127881; <strong>Congrats! You have now created the translation file to work with.</strong></p>
   </li>
</ol>

## Work on your translation

<ol start="8">

   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".propose-changes" %}</p>
   <figure class="propose-changes screenshot">

</ol>

## Prepare your draft Pull Request

<ol start="11">
   <li>
   <p>You are now in the "Comparing changes" view, between the "base" repository (the original W3C repository, beginning with w3c) and the "head" repository (your forked repository, beginning with your username).</p>
   <p>Click on "Create pull request", meaning that you propose to apply your changes to the official repository. If the button does not appear, you may need to refresh the page.    {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".compare-changes" %}</p>
   <figure class="compare-changes screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/compare-changes.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the ‚ÄúComparing changes‚Äù view in GitHub. The ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù button is outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li><p>Set the title of the Pull request using the following format: <strong>[IN-PROGRESS] Language - Resource Title.</strong></p>
   <p>Then, in the "Create pull request" button, select the drop-down arrow and select "Create draft pull request in the drop-down options. {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".create-draft-pull-request" %}
</p>
   <figure class="create-draft-pull-request screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/create-draft-pull-request.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the ‚ÄúOpen a pull request‚Äù form in GitHub. The pull request title is ‚Äú[IN-PROGRESS] French - Tips for Designing‚Äù. The drop-down arrow in the ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù button is selected: the second option ‚ÄúCreate draft pull request‚Äù is visible." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li><p>Click on the "Draft pull request" button to confirm the submission of the pull request.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".draft-button" %}</p>
   <figure class="draft-button screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/draft-button.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the main button of the form is now ‚ÄúDraft pull request‚Äù." %}
   </figure>
   <p>&#127881; <strong>Congrats! Your draft pull request is now created!</strong></p>
   </li>
</ol>

## Preview your changes

<ol start="14">
   <li>After you submit the pull request, it will create a preview so you can check your file and make edits. At first, a notification comment will say <strong>"üë∑ Deploy Preview for <em>wai-repo-name</em> processing."</strong>
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".preview-processing" %}
   <figure class="preview-processing screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/preview-processing.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Pull request view in GitHub. A comment created by netlify starts with ‚Äúüë∑ Deploy Preview for wai-quick-start processing.‚Äù" %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li><p>After a few minutes, the notification comment will change to <strong>‚Äú‚úÖ Deploy Preview for <em>wai-repo-name</em> ready!‚Äù</strong>.</p>
   <p>To see your preview, click on the "Deploy Preview" link. {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".preview-ready" %}</p>
   <figure class="preview-ready screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/preview-ready.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Pull request view in GitHub. The netlify comment now starts with ‚Äú‚úÖ Deploy Preview for wai-quick-start ready!‚Äù. A Deploy Preview link is visible, outlined in dark orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
</ol>

## Mark your Pull request as ready for review

<ol start="16">
<li><p>When you have done all your checks and edits, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the Pull request view, to change the title prefix "[IN-PROGRESS]" to <strong>"[Ready for Review]"</strong></p>
   <p>Then, click on the "Ready for review" button, at the bottom of the Pull request view. {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".ready-for-review-button" %}</p>
   <figure class="ready-for-review-button screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/ready-for-review-button.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a section of the Pull request view. Next to ‚ÄúThis pull request is still a work in progress‚Äù, the ‚ÄúReady for review‚Äù button is outlined in orange." %}
   </figure>
   </li>
   <li><p>&#127881; <strong>Congratulations, your pull request is now ready for review!</strong></p>
   <p>You can see it is marked as "Open" with a green label at the top of the Pull request view.
   {% include showhidebutton.html showtext="Show screenshot" hidetext="Hide screenshot" target=".ready-for-review-state" %}</p>
   <figure class="ready-for-review-state screenshot">
      {% include image.html src="about/translating/ready-for-review-state.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an open pull request in GitHub. The title of the pull request is ‚Äú[Ready for review] French - Tips for Designing‚Äù. A green label ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù is present below the title." %}

   </li>
</ol>
