## Overview

There are 4 steps to provide a dubbed version of a WAI video:

1. [Request permission](#permission)
2. [Provide subtitles, or use existing ones](#subtitles)
3. [Dub the video](#dubbing)
4. [Deliver the final video to W3C](#review)

## Step 1: Request permission {#permission}

Before starting the production of a dubbed video, you must ask and receive permission from W3C. Please email your request to <group-wai-translations@w3.org>, or open a new issue [in the `wai-translations` GitHub repository  {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-translations/).

In your message, state that you agree to contribute under the [Translation agreement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/#translation-agreement). 

Some videos have a separate version with audio description – for example, the [Perspective Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/). In such cases, we will only accept intents to translate _both_ versions of the video.

## Step 2: Provide subtitles, or use existing ones {#subtitles}

- If the video does not have subtitles in your language, please provide a text translation of the English captions/subtitles file. See the [workflow for creating video subtitles](/about/translating/resources/subtitles/).
- Some videos already have subtitles. If you would like to update the existing subtitles, or if you would like to change the wording to be smoother in your language, please request approval via e-mail <group-wai-translations@w3.org>.

In any case, please submit your script for approval by the W3C team before recording.

## Step 3: Dub the video {#dubbing}

The dubbed version must include the entire original video, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI.

Any changes to the video must be first approved by the W3C team.

## Step 4: Deliver the final video to W3C {#review}

When the dubbed video is ready, provide it to <group-wai-translations@w3.org> for final review and publication. 

Please note that W3C retains copyright to the video. We may publish the video on our website, YouTube channel, and other places. The video can be used by you and others following the License terms.
