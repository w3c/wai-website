## Introduction

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops video resources to help everyone understand and implement accessibility. 

We welcome volunteer dubbing of our videos. Your contribution can make this content reach broader audiences and facilitate learning without linguistic barriers.

Unless otherwise indicated, all WAI videos are published under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/copyright/document-license-2023/). If you are interested in dubbing videos under this license, please reach out for permission first, and follow the steps described below.

Some videos are licensed under a Creative Commons License. If this happens, the applicable license is specified in the YouTube description and in the footer of the page on the WAI website. For example: “This video is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.” For derivative works, please refer to the terms of the license specified.

## Workflow

There are 4 steps to provide a dubbed version of a WAI video:

1. [Express your interest](#interest)
2. [Get the source materials](#source-materials)
3. [Dub the video](#dubbing)
4. [Deliver the final video to W3C](#review)

### Step 1: Express your interest {#interest}

Before starting the production of a dubbed video, contact us first to let us know which video(s) you'd like to dub and in what language.

Email your request to <group-wai-translations@w3.org>, or open a new issue [in the `wai-translations` GitHub repository  {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-translations/).

Note that you will be bound by the following terms when you contribute:
- You agree that all contributed materials will be governed by the W3C Document License. Your dubbed version may be republished by the W3C and other entities if it is done in compliance with the license terms.
- W3C will retain attribution of authorship. W3C makes no a-priori commitment to support contributions.

Some videos have a separate version with audio description – for example, the [Perspective Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/). In such cases, we will only accept intents to dub _both_ versions of the video.

### Step 2: Get the source materials {#source-materials}

Once your contribution is approved, we'll provide you with:
- the original video
- the original captions and transcript files
- the existing subtitles and transcript files in your language (if any)

If the video already have subtitles or transcript in your language, you should use them for your script. If you would like to update the existing subtitles or transcript, or if you would like to change the wording to be smoother in your language, you'll need approval from W3C.

If the video does not have subtitles and transcript in your language, you'll need to translate the captions and the transcript.

In any case, please submit the final script for approval by the W3C team before recording.

### Step 3: Dub the video {#dubbing}

The dubbed version must include the entire original video, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI.

We generally do not allow changes to the videos. If you have suggestions for changes based on the translation, they must first be approved by the W3C team.

### Step 4: Deliver the final video to W3C {#review}

When the dubbed video is ready, provide it to <group-wai-translations@w3.org> for final review and publication.

We may publish the video on our website, YouTube channel, and other places. The video can be used by you and others following the License terms.
