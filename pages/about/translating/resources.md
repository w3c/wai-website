## Overview 

There are 6 steps to contribute as a volunteer translator:

1. **[Find a resource to translate](#find-resource)**

2. **[Inform us of your intent to translate a resource](#intent)**

3. **[Translate the resource](#start-translation)**

4. **[Preview and check your translation](#preview)**

5. **[Ask for reviews](#review)**

6. **[Wait for publication](#publication)**

Before starting your work, please take the time to read the information in [[Translating WAI Resources]](/about/translating/), and verify that you are willing to contribute under these policies.

## GitHub

We encourage you to use GitHub, especially if you intend to become a regular translator. 

Discussions, collaboration with reviewers and progress tracking are more easily managed in GitHub.

- If you are new to GitHub, [sign up {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/signup) for an account. We also recommend that you follow this interactive free course: [Introduction to GitHub {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github);
- For more specific guidance during the translation process, you can deep dive with our [[Using Github]](/about/translating/resources/using-github/) guide.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Important Note" class="simple" %}
{:/}

We hope you find benefits in using GitHub to contribute. That said, we do not expect translators to be or become GitHub experts. 

If you are unsure how to proceed and need guidance; or if you are not comfortable with GitHub at all: please send e-mail to [group-wai-translations@w3.org](mailto:group-wai-translations@w3.org) [^1]. We will be happy to guide you through GitHub or look for alternatives more suitable for you.

## Step 1: Find a resource to translate {#find-resource}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

### Have a look at our priorities

For suggestions on which to translate first, see [Priorities for Translations](#priorities).

### Or pick a resource according to your preference

You are welcome to translate any current WAI resource that you think would be useful in your language.

The easiest way to find a resource to translate is to head over to the dedicated [translations sitemap for your language](/about/translating/sitemaps/).

### We welcome new subtitles!

If you do not have the time to translate a resource, how about adding new subtitles to our videos?

[Video Introduction](/videos/standards-and-benefits/), [Perspective Videos](/perspective-videos/), [Stories of Web Users](/people-use-web/user-stories/), etc. We have many videos to choose from.

You are very welcome to [create new subtitles](/about/translating/resources/subtitles/) in your language, even if you do not intend to translate the page content.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Step 2: Inform us of your intent to translate a resource {#intent}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="New volunteer?" class="highlighted" %}
{:/}
 Thank you so much for your interest in translating W3C WAI Resources! 

To begin your journey, send an email to [group-wai-translations@w3.org](group-wai-translations@w3.org) (not publicly archived&nbsp;[^1]) to express your interest in joining the WAI translator volunteers community.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

When you have found a resource to translate, you must indicate your interest, and wait for a reply from WAI team. We'll check that the file isn't currently being translated by someone else, and that it isn't about to be updated. 

Please wait for reply from WAI team before starting a translation.

### Recommended / quickest way {#translation-issue}

1. From the [translations sitemap](/about/translating/sitemaps/) for your language, click on the "Volunteer to translate this page" link, displayed next to the resource you intend to translate.
2. It will automatically pre-fill a GitHub issue with some useful information. 
3. Read and submit the issue.

### Alternatives:
  - [Create an Issue in the dedicated "WAI Translations" repository](https://github.com/w3c/wai-translations/issues/new).
  - If you are not comfortable with GitHub, send e-mail to the publicly-archived WAI translations list using [this e-mail template](mailto:public-wai-translations@w3.org?subject=%5Blang%5D%20Intent%20to%20Translate%3A%20%5Btitle%5D&body=I%20would%20like%20to%20translate%20into%20%5Blanguage%5D%20the%20following%20resource%3A%0A%5BEnglish%20title%5D%0A%5BURI%5D%0A%0AI%20have%20read%20the%20information%20on%20Translating%20WAI%20Documents%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FWAI%2Fabout%2Ftranslating%2F%0A%0AI%20will%20wait%20for%20confirmation%20that%20the%20resource%20is%20ready%20for%20translation.). 

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Step 3: Start translating {#start-translation}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

### Initial setup

1. Log in to your existing GitHub account, or [create one {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/signup).
2. Get to the repository of the resource you will translate. 
  - Near the bottom of each page on the WAI website, there is a "Help improve this page" box. The middle button is "Fork & Edit in GitHub". That gets you to the repository. 
  - If you have followed the [recommended way](#translation-issue) to declare your intent, the link to the repository has been automatically added in the GitHub issue description.
3. You can directly work from there.

For further guidance on using GitHub to translate a WAI resource, follow the [dedicated guide](/about/translating/resources/using-github/).

### Translate the resource

- Refer to [[How to Translate a WAI Resource]](/about/translating/resources/technical-steps/) guide
  - If the page you are translating has videos, also refer to [[How to Create Translated Video Subtitles and Descriptions]](/about/translating/resources/video-subtitles/)
  - If the page you are translating has images with text, also refer to [[How to Translate Images]](/about/translating/resources/video-subtitles/)
- Commit your changes.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Step 4: Preview and check your translation {#preview}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

1. Open a [draft Pull Request {% include_cached external.html %}](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) in the GitHub repository of the resource, with `[IN-PROGRESS]` at the beginning of the title.

2. After you submit the pull request, a Netlify preview will be generated so you can check your file and make edits.
  - At first it will say **"👷 Deploy Preview for _wai-repo-name_ processing."**.
  - When done, it will say **"✅ Deploy Preview for _wai-repo-name_ ready!"** and a "Deploy Preview" link will appear.

3. Click on the preview link:
  - Check everything listed in [Reviewer Guidance](/about/translating/reviewing/#initial-things-to-check);
  - Eventually, commit some fixes;
  - At this point, if you encounter some technical problems, ask for help from WAI team.

4. When your auto-review is done, go to the next step.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Step 5: Ask for reviews {#review}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Translations are reviewed before they are published.

1. [Change the state of your pull request to "Ready for review" {% include_cached external.html %}](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) and change the beginning of your Pull Request title to `[READY FOR REVIEW]`
2. Communicate your Pull Request is ready for review in the [GitHub issue created at step 2](#intent).
3. Review discussions take place directly in the GitHub Pull Request. Work together with reviewer(s) to:
   - fix issues;
   - accurately convey the meaning from the English version;
   - consider different dialects.

If you have any questions about the wording, please report them in the GitHub issue so that WAI team and other volunteers can help.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Step 6: Wait for publication {#publication}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

When the review is done, WAI team will:
- do some final checks;
- merge the Pull Request;
- publish the translation on WAI website.

Please note these steps may take some time depending on other ongoing priorities.
