## W3C WAI

The World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/about/)) is an international [public-interest non-profit organization](https://www.w3.org/news/2022/w3c-to-become-a-public-interest-non-profit-organization/) where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is a key aspect of W3C's work for the benefit of humanity.

This information extends the [W3C Mission](https://www.w3.org/mission/) (vision, identity, design principles, strategic goals) to address accessibility specifics.

### Mission

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the web accessible to people with disabilities.

See [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) and [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/).

### Vision

The W3C vision is that the Web and related technologies are accessible so that all people with disabilities around the globe can **participate equally** in the digital world. That includes:
* Accessibility standards/guidelines are harmonized globally.
* All technical standards and specifications support accessibility.
* Tools that create and deliver digital content support accessibility.
* Everyone who creates or manages digital products has relevant accessibility knowledge.
* New technologies, digital products, and content addresses accessibility from inception (“born accessible”).

### High-Level Objectives

To contribute to realizing the vision, W3C addresses the following areas:

1. **Specifications, standards, and technologies support accessibility:**
   - Ensure that W3C specifications support accessibility.
   - Provide guidance on accessibility in other specifications and technologies.

2. **International accessibility standards:**
   - Facilitate international multi-stakeholder development and communication so the standards can be adopted and implemented internationally.
   - Develop technical specifications to support accessibility, such as [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) and accessibility API mappings.
   - Develop accessibility standards/guidelines for relevant tools and content.
   - Provide guidance beyond what can be included in these standards, such as [WCAG Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/).
   
3. **Support understanding, adopting, and implementing accessibility:**
   - Facilitate and promote translations of W3C accessibility standards and supporting resources.
   - Provide documentation on understanding and implementing accessibility standards.
   - Provide awareness and education resources, such as many listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/).

4. **Accessibility research**:
   - Encourage effective international research to provide a solid basis for accessibility standards.
   - Conduct horizon scanning.
