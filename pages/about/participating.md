## Implement accessibility

- If you help to develop online products and services, consider ways to make them as accessible as possible &mdash; implement the best practices in [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
- If you develop authoring tools &mdash; any software or service that people use to create or modify web content, including content management systems &mdash; implement the best practices in [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/).
- If you develop web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, or other user agents &mdash; implement the best practices in [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/).

## Advocate for accessibility

Encourage:

- authoring tools to meet [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) by:
  - directly contacting vendors and requesting increased accessibility support in future versions
  - purchasing tools that provide the best support for accessibility &mdash; see [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software)
- web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and other user agents to meet [UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)
- organizations to adopt an accessibility policy that defines their commitment to web accessibility &mdash; see [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/pol)
- websites to be accessible by [Contacting organizations about inaccessible websites](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible.html).
