## Introduction

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides an international
forum for collaboration between industry, disability organizations,
accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web
accessibility.

We encourage individuals and organizations around the world to
participate in activities that help improve accessibility of the web.

_After you read this page_, if you have any questions about getting involved with WAI or would like more information, please send specific questions to [Shawn@w3.org with CC to wai@w3.org](mailto:shawn@w3.org?cc=wai@w3.org&subject=Participating%20in%20WAI).

## Getting News of Drafts for Review  {#news}

Draft documents for review are listed on the WAI home page and [News page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/).

You can subscribe to get announcements via e-mail, Atom/RSS feed, or Twitter from [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/).

## Participating in Guidelines and Groups

See [**How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C
Process: Milestones and Opportunities to
Contribute**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php) to learn how
WAI works through a process designed to:

-   ensure broad community input, and
-   encourage consensus development.

### Reviewing Guidelines and Documents

WAI welcomes comments on documents at any time. Comments are handled
differently depending on the stage of document development. See the
["Feedback on Specific Documents" section of Contacting
WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/contacts#feedback-on-specific-documents) for where to send
comments.

One of the best times to comment on developing documents is during a
formal period for public review. To get notified of open calls for review, see via e-mail, Atom/RSS feed, or Twitter from [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/).

### Participating in Community Groups {#CGs}

W3C Community Groups cover a variety of topics. **Anyone can join Community Groups**, after getting a free W3C account and signing the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement. Of the long [list of Community Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/), here are some that are actively seeking contributors:
* [ACT Rules CG](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/)
* [ARIA and Assistive Technologies CG](https://www.w3.org/community/aria-at/)
* [Cognitive Accessibility CG](https://www.w3.org/community/coga-community/)
* [Immersive Captions CG](https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-captions/)
* [Low Vision CG](https://www.w3.org/community/low-vision/)

### Participating in Interest Groups  {#IG}

The [WAI Interest Group (WAI IG)](/WAI/IG) is for general discussion and
feedback on all areas of WAI's work. Most of the interaction within WAI
IG is through the public mailing list.

### Participating in Working Groups  {#WGs}

Anyone can join a WAI Working Group public mailing list, or read the
public list archives.

There are specific criteria for formally joining Working Groups,
including requirements for participation and contribution. See the
Working Group pages below to find what group best fits your interests
and to get information on participation.

-   **[AG WG](/WAI/GL)** &mdash; The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group develops guidelines for web pages, web applications, and other web content. **See [Participating in AG WG](/WAI/GL/participation)**.
-   **[APA](/WAI/APA/)** &mdash; The Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group reviews W3C's specifications for accessibility support and develops technical support materials. **See [Participating in APA WG](/WAI/APA/participation)**.
-   **[ARIA](/WAI/ARIA/)** &mdash; The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group develops a suite of accessible rich internet applications (ARIA) resources, and accessible APIs and mappings. **See [Participating in ARIA WG](/WAI/ARIA/participation)**.

## Sponsoring WAI

WAI's work is supported in part by sponsorship from industry,
disability, and government organizations interested in contributing to
WAI's efforts to make the web more accessible. Please see the list of
current sponsors and information on WAI sponsorship at [Sponsoring
WAI]({{"/about/sponsoring/" | relative_url }}).

## Promoting and Implementing Web Accessibility

### Promoting Awareness

-   Share links to the "[Perspectives Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/)" that show the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations.
-   Encourage people to take the [Digital Accessibility Foundations - Free Online Course](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/foundations-course/)
-   Cover web accessibility in [presentations and
    training](http://www.w3.org/WAI/train) to web developers, designers,
    managers, and others. Use the [curricula](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/) to develop courses.
-   Look around the W3C WAI website to find other [accessibility resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/) for specific [roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/roles/) that you want to share on social media, within your organization, and with others.

### Implementing Guidelines

-   Use the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    (WCAG)](/standards-guidelines/wcag/) documents to help make your website
    accessible.
-   If you develop authoring tools—any software or service that people
    use to create or modify web content, including content management
    systems—implement the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
    (ATAG)](/standards-guidelines/atag/).
-   If you develop web browsers, media players, assistive technologies,
    or other user agents—implement the [User Agent Accessibility
    Guidelines (UAAG)](/standards-guidelines/uaag/).

### Encouraging Accessibility

-   [Encourage authoring tools](/WAI/impl/software) to meet
    [ATAG](/standards-guidelines/atag/) by directly contacting
    vendors and requesting increased accessibility support in future
    versions, and by purchasing tools that provide the best support for
    accessibility.
-   Encourage web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and
    other user agents to meet
    [UAAG](/standards-guidelines/uaag/).
-   Encourage organizations to [adopt an accessibility
    policy](/WAI/impl/pol) for their organization that defines their
    commitment to web accessibility.
-   Encourage websites to be accessible, for example, provide [feedback
    on inaccessible websites and inaccessible web products
    carefully](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible.html); it is
    usually more productive to start with a positive encouraging tone,
    rather than a negative critical tone.
