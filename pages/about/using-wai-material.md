## Introduction

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops material to help make the web accessible to people with disabilities. **As with all W3C material, WAI material is generally available for you to use, for free**, with the two conditions below. For example, you can use WAI material by linking to it from your blog, putting it on a USB flash drive and handing it out at a conference, copying it on your intranet, printing it and handing it out to students, including it in a book, etc.

**There are two conditions for using most WAI material**; you must:

1.  Clearly attribute the original source as specified below, and
2.  Not modify the content (with few exceptions noted below).

Please read below for more details, including [**some material that is specially-marked content that you can modify**](#cc).

## Official W3C Document License

Most WAI material (including the standards and guidelines) is provided under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents) which grants permission to copy and distribute complete documents in any medium for any purpose, without fee or royalty, provided that you **include URL, copyright, and status** (if it exists). This does not allow modifications or the creation of derivative works, so as to prevent interoperability problems and other problems. For more information, see the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620).
