## Introduction

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops material to help make the web accessible to people with disabilities. **As with all W3C material, WAI material is generally available for you to use, for free**, with the two conditions below. For example, you can use WAI material by linking to it from your blog, putting it on a USB flash drive and handing it out at a conference, copying it on your intranet, printing it and handing it out to students, including it in a book, etc.

**There are two conditions for using most WAI material**; you must:

1.  Clearly attribute the original source as specified below, and
2.  Not modify the content (with few exceptions noted below).

Please read below for more details, including [**some material that is specially-marked content that you can modify**](#cc).

## Official W3C Document License

Most WAI material (including the standards and guidelines) is provided under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents) which grants permission to copy and distribute complete documents in any medium for any purpose, without fee or royalty, provided that you **include URL, copyright, and status** (if it exists). This does not allow modifications or the creation of derivative works, so as to prevent interoperability problems and other problems. For more information, see the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620).

## Creative Commons Licensed (CC) Material for You to Adapt
{:#cc}

A few WAI Resources are specifically designed for you to adapt, such as presentation slides. These are provided under a Creative Commons License (CC). We are happy for you to edit, change, and present such CC material *under the following conditions*:

1.  You **include the URI (web address), copyright, and status** (if it exists, e.g., "Draft") of the original WAI material.
2.  You **clearly attribute the material** appropriately.<br>
    
    Here is a template you can use:<br>

    > This *\[presentation\]* is based on *\[slides\]* from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI): ***\[title\]***. *\[name\]*, ed. Copyright © 0000  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C®). *Date: 00 Month 0000*. *www.w3.org/WAI/great/page*

## Finding Which Type of License

Unless otherwise indicated, all WAI material not covered by another license is published under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231).

## Videos
You may use W3C WAI videos in your presentations, training, etc. Please use the entire video, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI

### Translations

You may create dubbed versions of videos with the following conditions:
1. You provide a text translation of the English captions/subtitle file for use with the W3C video. You can then use that translation as the script for the dubbing.
2. The entire video is provided, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI
3. The translation is accurate. If you would like to change the wording to be smoother in your language, you get it approved by W3C staff before recording.
4. The new video is accessible:<br>
   a. You provide text subtitles/captions for your video. They may be "closed captions" that are only shown if turned on.<br>
   b. If the video has a descriped version, you also provide a translation of the described video.
5. Optionally, you may include your organization name and logo at the beginning and/or end, indicating that you are the translating organization. It must be clear that the video is from W3C. You may _not_ include your logo throughout the video.
6. You make the video available for others to use. This includes permission for W3C to put it on our website, YouTube channel, and other places. W3C retains copyright to the video.

To start translating the English captions/subtitle VTT file, or if you have any questions, please e-mail <group-wai-translations@w3.org>

For information on translating other WAI resources, see [Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/).

## Appropriate Use

As stated in the W3C [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#annotate): W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute derivative works if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity.
