## Introduction

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops material to help make the web accessible to people with disabilities. **As with all W3C material, WAI material is generally available for you to use, for free**, with the two conditions below. For example, you can use WAI material by linking to it from your blog; putting it on a USB flash drive and handing it out at a conference; copying it on your intranet; printing it and handing it out to students; and including it in a book.

**There are two conditions for using most WAI material**; you must:

1.  clearly attribute the original source as specified below, and
2.  not modify the content (with a few exceptions ,noted below).

See below for more details, including [**some specially marked material that you can modify for your use**](#cc).

## Official W3C Document License

Most WAI material (including the standards and guidelines) is provided under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents), which grants permission to copy and distribute complete documents in any medium for any purpose, without fee or royalty, provided that you **include the URL, copyright, and status** (if it exists). This does not allow modifications or the creation of derivative works, so as to prevent interoperability problems and other problems. For more information, see the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620).

## Creative Commons Licensed (CC) material for you to adapt
{:#cc}

A few WAI resources are specifically designed for you to adapt, such as presentation slides. These are provided under a Creative Commons License (CC). We are happy for you to edit, change, and present such CC material **under the following conditions**:

1.  You **include the URI (web address), copyright, and status** (if it exists, e.g., "Draft") of the original WAI material.
2.  You **clearly attribute the material** appropriately.<br>
    
    Here is a template you can use:<br>

    > <i>This *\[presentation\]* is based on *\[slides\]* from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI): ***\[title\]***. *\[name\]*, ed. Copyright © 0000  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C®). *Date: 00 Month 0000*. *www.w3.org/WAI/great/page*</i>

    For example:

    > Some information in this article is from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)) document: [Curricula on Web Accessibility: A Framework to Build Your Own Courses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/). Daniel Montalvo and Shadi Abou-Zahra, eds. Copyright © 2024 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C®). Date: Updated 31 August 2022. <https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/>

3.  You do not suggest that W3C or WAI endorses you or your use of the material.
4.  You abide by the license terms; most are [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Finding which type of license

Unless otherwise indicated, all WAI material not covered by another license is published under the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231).

For material under the Creative Commons License, the footer includes the license, such as: "This work is published and licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)."

## Videos
You may use W3C WAI videos in your presentations, training, etc. Please use the entire video, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI.

### Translations

You may create dubbed versions of videos with the following conditions:

1.  You provide a text translation of the English captions/subtitle file for use with the W3C video &mdash; you can then use that translation as the script for the dubbing.
2.  The entire video is provided, including the ending with the link to w3.org/WAI.
3.  The translation is accurate &mdash; if you would like to change the wording to be smoother in your language, you must get it approved by W3C staff before recording.
4.  The new video is accessible:
   - You provide captions / text subtitles for your video. They should generally be "closed captions" that are only shown if turned on.
   - If the video has an audio description (of the visual information), you also provide a translation of the audio description.
5.  Optionally, you may include your organization's name and logo at the beginning and/or end, indicating that you are the translating organization &mdash; it must be clear that the video is from W3C; and you may _not_ include your logo throughout the video.
6.  You make the video available for others to use &mdash; this includes permission for W3C to put it on our website, YouTube channel, and other places; W3C retains copyright to the video.

To start translating the English captions/subtitle VTT file, or if you have any questions, please email <group-wai-translations@w3.org>.

For information on translating other WAI resources, see [Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/).

## Let us know

When you use WAI material, please let us know by emailing <wai-eo-editors@w3.org> (a publicly-archived list) or, if you do not want it public, email <wai@w3.org>.

For presentations, we would appreciate knowing how many people attended, what questions they had, and other information.

We welcome your suggestions to improve WAI materials &mdash; email your feedback to <wai-eo-editors@w3.org>.

## Appropriate use

As stated in the W3C [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#annotate): W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute derivative works if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity.
