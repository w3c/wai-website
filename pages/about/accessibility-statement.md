<h2 id="measures-to-support-accessibility">Measures to support accessibility</h2>
<p>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of the WAI website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include accessibility as a requirement for all web content. Content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA, and should meet AAA as feasible.</li>
<li>Assign clear accessibility goals and responsibilities.</li>
<li>Ensure content authors have accessibility knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Include accessibility as part of our mission.</li>
<li>Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.</li>
<li>Usability test with participants with disabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conformance-status">Conformance status</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> standard defines requirements to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. &quot;Fully conforms&quot; means that the content meets all of the WCAG requirements at the specified Level without  exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>WAI website content posted since May 2018 fully conforms to WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</strong> It partially conforms to Level AAA.</p>
<p>Older content conforms to earlier versions of WCAG, for example, WCAG 2.0. Most of the older content is archived and will not be updated.</p>
