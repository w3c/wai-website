Thank you for your interest in translating resources from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

## Translation Instructions

**Scope:**
* These instructions cover web pages with a URI that begins with www.w3.org/WAI
* For web pages that begin with www.w3.org/TR/ or something else, there is a different process that is introduced in [TR & Authorized W3C Translations below](#tr).

**Translator background** &mdash; we prefer translators to be:
* native speakers
* familiar with accessibility terminology in their language
* comfortable editing a file with code

To avoid overlapping work:
* please do **not** translate files from the web
* follow the [step-by-step guide](/about/translating/resources/) to _get the right file to translate_ and to ensure that the resource is ready for you to translate.

### If you want to translate a WAI resource:

- Follow instructions in [[Step-by-Step Guide to Translating WAI Resources]](/about/translating/resources/).

### If you want to volunteer to review a translation:

- Follow instructions in [[Reviewing a Translation]](/about/translating/reviewing/).

We encourage you to keep up on related translations work by [subscribing to the WAI Translations mailing list](mailto:public-wai-translations-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe).
   
### Important notes

#### Translation Agreement

By submitting a translation, you agree:
* To the redistribution terms of the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/copyright/document-license-2023/). Your translation may be republished by the W3C or other entities if it is done in compliance with the License terms.
* That the W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity. ([Source](https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/#translate).)

#### Reviews

Translations will be reviewed before they are published.

#### Names and Links  {#links}

This policy is based on [Internationalization Links](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/translation.html#linkingrules), which provides some background.

Translations can include:

* Translator's formal name, common name used online, &/or Twitter handle.
   * Link to information about the translator as an individual, such as "about" page on personal website or biography page on a scholarly website.
* Organization name - translator's employer &/or other sponsor/funder of the translation.

Cannot include:
* Links to organizations. (Exception: Qualifying accessibility/disability organizations or translation organizations. To request an exception, e-mail [wai@w3.org with subject [Translations link request]](mailto:wai@w3.org?subject=%5BTranslations%20link%20request%5D).)
* Links to personal home pages rather than "about" pages.

#### Updating Resources

When the English version of a resource is updated, we will inform translators what has changed<!-- @@by GitHub &/or e-mail -->, and request that translators update their translation. If original translators do not respond before we need the update, we will invite others to update the translation.

In some cases, we will add the updated English to the translation while awaiting an update. If the changes are substantive, the translation may be removed until an updated version is provided.

#### W3C Translations Information

More information is available in [W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/) and in <a href="https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/">W3C Intellectual Rights FAQ</a>, particularly under the questions starting with <a href="https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/#translate">can I translate one of your specifications into another language?</a>

## TR & Authorized W3C Translations {#tr}

Web pages at URIs that begin with www.w3.org/TR/ (for "Technical Report") follow a different process described in [W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/).

Most translations are informative and unofficial. In cases where standards translations are meant for official purposes, they may be developed as Authorized W3C Translations according to the **[Policy for Authorized W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy.html)**. Generally only completed W3C Recommendations and Working Group Notes are candidates for Authorized W3C Translations, including the WAI guidelines. The authorized translations policy is designed to ensure transparency and community accountability in the development of authorized translations under the oversight of W3C.

* [WCAG 2 Translations](/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/) lists in-progress and completed translations of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, 2.1 and 2.0, including unofficial translations and Authorized W3C Translations. To translate WCAG 2, follow the instructions at [[How to translate WCAG 2]](/about/translating/wcag/).
* [Authorized Translations of W3C Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/Translations/authorized.html) lists completed Authorized W3C Translations of WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.0, Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0, and others.
