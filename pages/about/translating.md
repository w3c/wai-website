This page provides general instructions on translating WAI standards and resources.

We welcome your help making Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) resources available in your language. Join the volunteer translation community to raise awareness of digital accessibility among a global audience.

For a list of existing translations, see [All WAI Translations](/translations/).

W3C staff temporarily has limited availability to support WAI translations. 

We expect to be back to full support by mid-February 2025. Thank you very much for your patience, if we are not able to reply to you until then. We greatly appreciate contributions and look forward to supporting you as soon as possible.

## Ways to contribute

You can contribute to WAI translations in many ways:

[Providing video captions/subtitles](/about/translating/resources/subtitles/)
: This is the easiest way to start contributing, especially if you are not technical.

[Translating a WAI resource](/about/translating/resources/)
: You are welcome to provide a translation for educational resources on WAI website (web pages with a URL that begins with `www.w3.org/WAI`). It is best if you are comfortable editing a file with code.

[Reviewing WAI resources translations](/about/translating/reviewing/)
: You can help spot issues in translations before publication, even if you are not technical or do not know the translated language.

[Creating a WCAG Unofficial translation {% include_cached external.html label="Different page format" %}](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/)
: You can create an unofficial translation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) after following a light process. Unofficial translations are not hosted on W3C website nor endorsed by W3C.

[Creating a WCAG Authorized translation](/about/translating/wcag/)
: You can develop an Authorized translation of WCAG that will be published on W3C website. It involves a formal process, coordination with stakeholder organizations, and a thorough review.

We encourage you to keep up on translations work by [subscribing to the WAI Translations mailing list](mailto:public-wai-translations-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe).

## Process

All contributions must go through the following main steps before publication. These steps are described in more detail in the specific process of each type of translation. Additional steps may also be necessary for some documents.

### 1. Intent to translate

Before starting a translation, verify that you are willing to contribute under the [Translation agreement](#translation-agreement). 

Then, **you must ask and receive permission from W3C**. It generally involves sending an email to a mailing list, or opening a GitHub issue in the relevant repository.

### 2. Translation

It involves the following steps:
- get the files to translate, from a GitHub repository or from WAI staff.
- edit the file(s) in a code editor.
- send the code for review: directly by opening a pull request in GitHub, or by sending the file(s) back to WAI staff.

To avoid overlapping work:
* please do **not** translate files from the Web.
* follow the guidance to get the right file to translate and to ensure that the resource is ready for you to translate.

### 3. Review

All translations are reviewed before they are published.
- WAI resources translations are reviewed by other volunteers and WAI staff. Once reviewed, they are published on the W3C WAI website.
- WCAG Candidate Authorized Translations (CAT) follow a formal review process described in the [Policy for Authorized W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy.html). Once reviewed, they are published on the W3C website.
- WCAG Unofficial translations follow a simpler review process.

## Additional information

### Translator background

We prefer translators to be:
* native speakers
* familiar with accessibility terminology in their language
* comfortable editing a file with code

### Translation Agreement {#translation-agreement}

By submitting a translation, you agree:
* To the redistribution terms of the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/copyright/document-license-2023/). Your translation may be republished by the W3C or other entities if it is done in compliance with the License terms.
* That the W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity. ([Source](https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/#translate))

### Crediting {#links}

Translations can include:
* Translator's formal name, common name used online, and/or X/Mastodon handle.
  * Link to information about the translator as an individual, such as "about" page on personal website or biography page on a scholarly website.
* Organization name - translator's employer and/or other sponsor/funder of the translation.

Cannot include:
* Links to organizations. (Exception: qualifying accessibility/disability organizations or translation organizations. To request an exception, e-mail [wai@w3.org with subject [Translations link request]](mailto:wai@w3.org?subject=%5BTranslations%20link%20request%5D).)
* Links to personal home pages rather than "about" pages.

This policy is based on [Internationalization Links](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/translation.html#linkingrules), which provides some background.

### Updating Resources

When the English version of a resource is substantively updated, we inform translators what has changed, and request that translators update their translation. If original translators do not respond before we need the update, we will invite others to update the translation.

In some cases, we will add the updated English to the translation while awaiting an update. If the changes are subtantial, the translation may be removed until an updated version is provided.

### W3C Translations Information

More information is available in [W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/) and in [W3C Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/), particularly under the questions starting with [May I translate a W3C specification into another language?](https://www.w3.org/copyright/intellectual-rights/#translate).

## TR & Authorized W3C Translations {#tr}

Web pages at URIs that begin with www.w3.org/TR/ (for "Technical Report") follow the process described in [W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/).

Most translations are informative and unofficial. In cases where standards translations are meant for official purposes, they may be developed as Authorized W3C Translations according to the **[Policy for Authorized W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy.html)**. Generally only completed W3C Recommendations and Working Group Notes are candidates for Authorized W3C Translations, including the WAI guidelines. The authorized translations policy is designed to ensure transparency and community accountability in the development of authorized translations under the oversight of W3C.

* [WCAG 2 Translations](/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/) lists in-progress and completed translations of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, 2.1 and 2.0, including unofficial translations and Authorized W3C Translations. To translate WCAG 2, follow the instructions at [[How to translate WCAG 2]](/about/translating/wcag/).
* [Authorized Translations of W3C Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/Translations/authorized.html) lists completed Authorized W3C Translations of WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.0, Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0, and others.
