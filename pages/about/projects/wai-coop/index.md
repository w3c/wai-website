## Project Results
{:#results}

**[List of Courses on Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/list/)**
:  Included developing a user interface with filtering functionality, creating a taxonomy to describe courses and certification on digital accessibility with mapping to the [WAI Curricula](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/), promoting and gathering list entries, and creating a [Course submission form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/submission/).

**[List of Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/)**
:  Included updating the user interface with filtering functionality, reviewing which tools' features to capture, promoting and gathering list entries, and creating a [Tool submission form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/submit-a-tool/).

**[List of Web Accessibility Laws and Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/)**
:  Made extensive updates to existing policies and added new information for 22 additional countries.

**[List of Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/)**
:  Included promoting, tracking, and validating implementations of “Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules” in automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies. Also included a completed [redesign of the user interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/implementations/) to better integrate implementation reports submitted by different vendors.

**Analysis of Support and Gaps in Technologies**
:  Carried out an extensive literature review to identify relevant accessibility related gaps in digital technologies, which helped to identify topics to explore further as part of the Research Symposia.

**Research Symposia on Digital Accessibility**
: Organised and ran three online research symposia based on topics identified in previous analyses:
  * [Shape the Future: Research and Development Questions in Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium1/)
  * [Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/research/ai2023/)
  * [Evaluating Accessibility: Meeting Key Challenges](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium3/)

**Regular Open Meetings**
: Organised and ran six open meetings to exchange best practices and discuss specific topics around implementing and monitoring accessibility.
  * [WAI-CooP introductory meeting](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-first-open-meeting/)
  * [Implementing the EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting2/)
  * [Monitoring the EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-online-meeting/)
  * [Exploring what can be done to improve supply of and access to digital accessibility expertise](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-11-october-2022/)
  * [Exploring the feedback mechanism and complaints procedure of the Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-7-march-2023/)
  * [Reviewing WAI CooP activities and the future of accessibility](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-14-november-2023/)

**[Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://web-directive.eu/)**
:  Provided responses to frequently asked questions (FAQ) on implementing the EU Web Accessibility Directive (WAD).

**[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/)**
:  Updated functionality, improved user interface, improved translation options, and updated to include new WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.

**[Easy Checks &mdash; A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/easy-checks/)**
:  Updated the resource to simplify the presentation of each check, reduce the reliance on third-party tools, and improve the readability of the content. The aim was to make it easier to use as a learning resource for people new to accessibility, and to create a set of tools to perform some basic accessibility checks.

## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-CooP, Communities of Practice, was a Coordination and Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 101004794). The project started on 1 January 2021 and was completed in December 2023. WAI-CooP supported implementation of the international standards for digital accessibility through:

-   establishing a vendor-neutral overview on available training, tools, and resources internationally
-   analyzing technological advancements and coordinating with relevant research and development
-   providing opportunities for key stakeholders to share resources and to exchange best practices

WAI-CooP achieved this by building on the existing wealth of authoritative guidance available from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to provide a one-stop shop for the broad spectrum of key stakeholders involved in the implementation of digital accessibility. This included public bodies and private entities; organisations representing people with disabilities; product, service, and training providers; researchers; and policy makers.
