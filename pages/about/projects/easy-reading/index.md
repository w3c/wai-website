## Project Work Packages
{:#deliverables}

- **Work package 1: IPAR-UCD Methodology Development and Application** - Development of an Inclusive Participatory Action Research approach for Research & Development (R&D) in the sense of design based research.
- **Work package 2: Innovative Interface Concepts** - Development of adaptive personalized user interface concepts for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.
- **Work package 3: Tracking and Reasoning** - Development of tracking engines that uses sensors (eye-tracker, MS Kinect etc.) and user input (touches, mouse movement, keystrokes) to detect and understand the situation the user faces (e.g. attention, stress, confusion).
- **Work package 4: Profiling and Knowledge Base** - Development of a module for individual user profiles and knowledge base and a system that is capable of matching requests for content simplification.
- **Work package 5: Automatic Translation/Annotation/Adaptation of Content and User-Interaction** - Implementation of services to feed the interface with alternative format and display of content.
- **Work package 6: Easy Reading Service Framework** - Development of a customizable and adaptable framework for adaptable digital content that is robust, flexible and validated.
- **Work package 7: Guidelines for Cognitive Web Accessibility** - Introduce and explain the use of W3C standards relevant to the project and relay feedback and learnings from the project into the W3C standardization process, to improve resources on people with cognitive and learning disabilities.
- **Work package 8: Privacy, Safety, Ethics** - Ensuring that issues related to privacy, safety and ethics are identified, avoided and mitigated in all parts and aspects of the project.
- **Work package 9: Dissemination, Exploitation & Communication** - Promoting adoption, because without adoption the social and business potential cannot be actualised.
- **Work package 10: Management** - Ensuring the effectiveness and the efficiency of the envisaged activities, pursuing the projectâ€™s objectives according to the time schedule, budget and the quality standards established, harmonizing the project results

## About the Project
{:#about}

Easy Reading, is an Research and Innovation Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 780529). The project is coordinated and led by the Johannes Keppler University (JKU), with the following partners:

- Johannes Keppler University (JKU), Austria, project coordinator
- Athena, Israel
- Dart, Sweden
- Funka, Sweden
- KI-I, Austria
- PIKSL, Germany
- Texthelp, UK
- TUD, Germany
- W3C, France

Easy Read aims to enable people with cognitive disabilities to better read, understand, and use web pages. It develops a software tool that supports people with cognitive and learning disabilities to personalize the content, such as simplifying the text and adjusting the presentation of text.

The role of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in this project is two-fold:

- Inform the project on relevant developments in W3C standardization, such as work on [personalization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/adapt/), [pronunciation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/), and requirements and supplemental guidance on people with [cognitive and learning disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/);
- Relay relevant feedback and learnings from the project, such as implementation experiences and user needs from working with the community, into W3C standardization and resource development.

See the [Easy Reading Project Website](https://www.easyreading.eu/) for more information on this project and contact [Shadi Abou-Zahra](http://www.w3.org/People/shadi/) for more questions on W3C's participation in this project.
