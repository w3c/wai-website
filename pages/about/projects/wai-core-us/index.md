## About WAI-Core

The WAI-Core US Project, funded by HHS, supports accessibility work at W3C. WAI-Core-funded staff lead the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) program and technical architecture for developing open, royalty-free standards and supporting resources through the W3C Process.

WAI-Core US Project staff lead work to:

* Develop standards, guidance, and supporting materials for accessibility of web sites, mobile apps, software, browsers, development tools, and other digital technology/information and communications technology (ICT)
* Review all W3C standards to ensure they support accessibility
* Develop technical specifications (such as WAI-ARIA) to fill gaps
* Document accessibility user requirements in emerging technologies and essential tools such as online meeting and collaboration tools, virtual or immersive environments (XR), and AI



## How to Participate

We welcome contributions to the work under WAI-Core US.

Anyone can review and comment on drafts in development. To get notifications of drafts for review, you can subscribe to [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/) via email, RSS feed, LinkedIn, and other social media.

If you want to be more involved in developing the work, you may be interested in participating in a WAI Working Group.
*   [[Accessibility Guidelines Working Group]](/about/groups/agwg/) develops accessibility guidelines, including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
*   [[Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group]](/about/groups/apawg/) reviews W3C charters, standards, and specifications for accessibility support; develops specifications to fill gaps; documents accessibility user requirements; and develops technical support material â€” including  through a research task force working on accessibility and AI.
*   [[ARIA Working Group]](/about/groups/ariawg/) develops technical specifications to support accessibility, including WAI- ARIA and application programming interface (API) mappings.

General information is available in [[Participating in WAI]](/about/participating/).
