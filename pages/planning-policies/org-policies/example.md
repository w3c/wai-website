## 2. Policy statement

    websites and services, will conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA success
    criteria.
2.  All existing web content published prior to the effective date of
    this policy will either be archived or modified to conform to WCAG
    2.0 Level AA success criteria. Web content hosted on ACME Inc.
    public websites will be addressed no later than August, 20XX. Web
    content hosted on internal websites will be addressed no later than
    September, 2016.
3.  All internal content management systems (CMS) and web content
    authoring tools will conform to ATAG Level AA success criteria by
    Jan, 2016. Where websites, services, or applications provide users
    with the opportunity to generate content, the interfaces provided
    will conform to ATAG Level AA.

    criteria by Jan, 2016. Where user agents are used as part of a
    website, service, or application, such as a media player, they will

## 3. Need for policy

1.  The June 2011 [World Health Organization (WHO) Report on
    Disability](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241564182)
    estimated that there are a billion people with disabilities. Many of
    these disabilities can affect access to information technologies,
    and/or can benefit from the use of information technologies
    including the Web.
2.  Accessibility of the Web is of critical importance to people with
    disabilities around the world, including people with auditory,
    cognitive, physical, neurological, and visual disabilities, and is
    likewise important to those with accessibility needs due to aging.
3.  Providing accessible web content can also benefit people who do not
    have disabilities but who are experiencing situational barriers. For
    instance, when accessing the Web from devices with small screens or
    in low bandwidth situations, or when experiencing barriers due to
    language or literacy levels, accessibility solutions can also
    support improved access.
4.  ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring equal access for people with
    disabilities. As potential customers and employees they are
    important contributor to ACME Inc. business success and should not
    be excluded.
5.  As a consequence of this policy, ACME Inc. will meet its legal
    obligations as defined by the @@@@.
