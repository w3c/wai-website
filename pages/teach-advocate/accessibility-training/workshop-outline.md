## Important Notes

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

This example workshop is not a complete set of training material.
Trainers will need to adapt the material to suit their audience. For example, for an in-house workshop, trainers should focus on the issues most common to the organization's content and development environment, and could use the organization's website and authoring tools for examples and activities.

This material assumes that trainers are experienced web accessibility practitioners and trainers. That is, it does not attempt to train trainers.

This outline is for an initial workshop. Follow up workshops might be needed. For example, content authors would benefit from specific instruction on how to use their content management system (CMS) or other authoring tools to provide accessible content.

### Additional notes for presenters for the technical sessions on days 2 and 3
{:.no_toc}

- Allow time at the end of each session to sum up the requirements and clarify any issues arising from the session.
- Finish days 1 and 2 with a brief summary of the day, and start days 2 and 3 with a brief summary of the previous day. Seek feedback at the end of each day and adjust remaining material as appropriate.
- Clarify that not all WCAG success criteria are being presented and discussed in this workshop.
- Describe the intent of accessibility requirements, and their relationship to barriers for people with disabilities and [older people](/older-users/). Also describe the broader benefits for [mobile users](/standards-guidelines/wcag-mobile-overlap/), search engine optimization (SEO), and more.
- Draw illustrative examples from sites and material that are relevant to the participants backgrounds, e.g. government, commerce, etc.
- The [Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/) provides accessible and inaccessible web pages, including evaluation reports, that can be used as examples. Using the participants' own websites or similar websites to theirs (such as websites from competitor organizations) helps make the examples more tangible.
- Emphasize the benefits of [How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/), a customizable quick reference to WCAG requirements and techniques, including 'best practice' advisory techniques.
- Introduce appropriate evaluation techniques and tools for each issue as it is covered.
- Carry out activities and exercises to reinforce the learning effect.
