## Notes:

Feel free to use this material as is or adapt it for your specific audience and goals, as long as you attribute it as described in the ["Creative Commons License (CC)" section of Using WAI Material](/about/using-wai-material/#cc).

We encourage you to share accessibility information. Understand your own level of knowledge (no one knows everything about accessibility), and be careful how you address sensitive topics. Be open with your audience about your background and level of expertise. If you get questions that you are unsure about, it's fine to say that you don't know the answer. That is a opportunity to look for the answer on the [WAI website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/yourWAI) with your audience, or say that you will find the answer later and then ask the question on the [WAI Interest Group mailing list](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist).
