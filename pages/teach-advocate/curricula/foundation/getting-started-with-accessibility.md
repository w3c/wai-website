### Topic: Developing Policies and Statements

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce students to accessibility policies for organizations and accessibility statements for websites. See [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](/planning/org-policies/) and [Developing an Accessibility Statement/](/planning/statements/). Emphasize that policies are mostly internal within organizations, whereas statements are public commitments on accessibility implementation.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe accessibility policies as a mechanism to reinforce commitment among the organization members.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define processes. If you do not have such documents, walk students through the different elements that are needed for an effective accessibility policy. Refer to [Accessibility Policies](/planning/org-policies/).
* Explore publicly-available accessibility statements and reflect with students on some of the aspects they include.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Report &mdash; Students draft an accessibility policy based on an organization of their choice. Assess students' capacity to define the scope of the policy, and to reference current standards.
* Presentation &mdash; Students draft an accessibility statement for a product of their choice and present it to their peers. Assess students' capacity to reflect on current status of the product and to demonstrate commitment to accessibility.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Multiple Choice Questions &mdash; From a given set of product features, students assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For example, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it?
