## Introduction
{:.no-display}

The developer modules guide the creation of courses that:

* introduce key accessibility terms for developers
* demonstrate and explain how accessible coding enables people with disabilities to use the Web
* teach accessible markup and coding techniques for:
  * page structure, orientation, and navigation
  * menus
  * images
  * tables
  * forms
  * custom widgets
  * rich applications

These modules focus on accessible markup and coding techniques. They are primarily designed for teaching front-end developers.

## Foundation Prerequisites

The developer modules are designed for students who have achieved the learning outcomes from the following subset of [Foundation modules](/curricula/foundation-modules/):

* [Module 1: What is Web accessibility](/curricula/foundation-modules/what-is-web-accessibility/)
  * Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities
  * Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility
* [Module 2: People and Digital Technology](/curricula/foundation-modules/people-and-digital-technology/)
  * Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Strategies
  * Topic: Components of Web Accessibility
* [Module 4: Principles, Standards, and Checks](/curricula/foundation-modules/principles-standards-and-checks/)
  * Topic: Principles of Web Accessibility
  * Topic: W3C Accessibility Standards
  * Topic: Hands-on Experience of Standards
* [Module 5: Getting Started with Accessibility](/curricula/foundation-modules/getting-started-with-accessibility/)
  * Topic: Roles and Responsibilities

In addition, students should have knowledge of HTML and CSS.
