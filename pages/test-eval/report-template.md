Introduction
----------------------
{:#intro.no_toc.no_display}

This document presents a recommended format for communicating results of
the evaluation of Web site accessibility according to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0. A consistent and comprehensive
evaluation report format can help ensure effective evaluations as well
as accurate comparisons of accessibility levels over time and between
different Web sites.

Suggested items in the report format may vary depending the context.
Words in brackets \[...\] are intended to be filled in with information
from the actual review. Related documents describing the evaluation
method, and organization of review teams, are listed in the References
section below.
