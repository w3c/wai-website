Introduction
------------
{:#intro.no_toc}

Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is an
approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)).

If you want to get a general sense of how a web page addresses a few
accessibility issues, see [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary.html). It is
usually best to do preliminary checks before applying WCAG-EM, and to
address potential accessibility barriers before investing in a more
thorough review such as WCAG-EM.

WCAG-EM is a supporting resource for the WCAG standard; it does not
define additional WCAG requirements. It is published as a W3C Working
Group Note.

### Scope

WCAG-EM applies to all websites, including web applications and mobile
websites. ****** It covers different situations, including
self-assessment and third-party evaluation. It is independent of
particular evaluation tools, web browsers, or assistive technologies.

WCAG-EM is primarily for evaluating conformance of existing websites.
However, accessibility should not be left until the evaluation stage; it
should be integrated from the beginning and throughout the project
lifecycle — in planning, design, and development.

Other aspects of evaluation are addressed in related pages of the
[Evaluating Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview)
resource suite. For example, guidance to help you better understand
real-world accessibility issues and evaluate effective accessibility
solutions is in [Involving Users in Evaluating Web
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users).

Who WCAG-EM is for {#for}
--------------------------

WCAG-EM is for anyone who wants a common procedure for auditing
websites. It is for direct use by internal evaluators, external
auditors, benchmarkers, and researchers. Additionally, WCAG-EM can be
referred to by managers, procurers, policy makers, regulators, and
others.

Applying WCAG-EM successfully requires knowledge of WCAG, accessible web
design, assistive technologies, and how people with different
disabilities use the Web (as described in the WCAG-EM [Required
Expertise ![technical
report](/Icons/tr.png)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#expertise)
section).

What is in WCAG-EM {#whatis}
-----------------------------

WCAG-EM provides guidance on using the methodology and considerations
for specific situations. The conformance evaluation procedure is
detailed under 5 main steps:

1.  **Define the scope of the evaluation** - defining what is included
    in the evaluation; the goal of the evaluation; and the WCAG
    conformance level (A, AA, AAA).
2.  **Explore the website** - identifying key web pages; key
    functionality; types of web content, designs, functionality, etc.;
    required web technologies.
3.  **Select a representative sample** - guidance on structured and
    randomly selected web pages when it is not feasible to evaluate
    every web page on a website.
4.  **Evaluate the selected sample** - determining successes and
    failures in meeting WCAG; accessibility support for website
    features; and recording evaluation steps.
5.  **Report the evaluation findings** - aggregating and reporting
    evaluation findings; making evaluation statements; and calculating
    overall scores.

### Technical document format

WCAG-EM follows the W3C format for technical specifications which
includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions,
editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the
email address for comments. There is a link at the top to the Table of
Contents.

WCAG-EM Report Tool {#wert}
----------------------------

The [**WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report
Generator**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/#/) helps
you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and generate a structured report from
the input that you provide.

Who develops WCAG-EM {#wg}
---------------------------

WCAG-EM is developed by the WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force
([Eval TF](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2011/eval/eval-tf)), which is a
joint task force of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working
Group ([WCAG WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) and Evaluation and Repair
Tools Working Group ([ERT WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/)). The Working
Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium
([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative
([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).
