  <p>Note about video description: The video on this page does not include synchronized audio description because the visuals only illustrate the audio and do not provide additional information. In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals.

Conformance evaluation determines how well web pages or applications meet accessibility standards. <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym>'s Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is an approach for determining conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

[[WCAG-EM Overview: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology]](/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/)
:   A short page with basic information to get you started. We suggest you read it before going to the [full WCAG-EM document](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

[WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/)
:   Helps you generate evaluation reports according to WCAG-EM. It does not do the checking for you. It helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and it generates a report from the input you provide.

[[Template for Web Accessibility Evaluation Reports]](/test-evaluate/report-template/)
:   Suggests information to include in a report.

[ATAG Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/)
:   Helps you generate a report on how a tool meets Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines ([ATAG](/standards-guidelines/atag/)). Authoring tools are software and services used to create web content – such as content management systems (CMS) and what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors.

[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/)
:  Describe how to test conformance of accessibility standards such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA. ACT Rules are primarily used by developers of test tools and methodologies. Accessibility testers may find some rules helpful for evaluating edge cases consistently.

<!-- Communicate the results of evaluation clearly, including the scope of the evaluation. -->

Specifications for expressing test results (EARL) and for writing accessibility test rules (Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format) are introduced in [Evaluation Standards Overview](/standards-guidelines/evaluation/).
