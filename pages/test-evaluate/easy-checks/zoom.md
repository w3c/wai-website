## What is Zoom?

Zoom is used to increase the size of text and images on web pages to make them more readable. In most browsers the 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' keys together with '+' will increase zoom. 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' with '-' will reduce zoom and 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' with '0' will reset it.

## Why is Zoom important?

People with low vision use zoom to increase the size of text and other elements, so they can see it better.
Some people only need to increase the text size a little, for example if they forgot their reading glasses. Others need to increase the text size a lot, for example up to 200% or even larger.


## Checking Zoom

### Checking this page

Practice checking how zoom works on this page. You can also see how zoom works on this accessible page. Follow these steps:

1. Resize your browser window so it's quite narrow, don't use a big wide browser window
1. Press 'Ctrl'/'Cmd' with '+' and repeat as often as you need to get the text to 200%, stop when you reach 200%

While you zoom in, see how:

- All the text wraps when you zoom, so you can always see the text
- This page has horizontal text, but you do not need to scroll horizontally

### Checking other pages

You can check other pages by following the steps listed above. But, if the page you're checking was not programmed with accessibility in mind, zooming in may make the content unusable.

### What to look for

* All text is readable
* Text is not hidden behind other text or images
* If the content uses a horizontal-writing system: you should not need to scroll horizontally to see all the content
* If the content uses a vertical-writing system: you should not need to scroll vertically to see all the content
* When zoomed in, navigation menus may change from the full menu into an icon that you can select to access the menu. This is fine
