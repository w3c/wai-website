## What is Zoom?

Zoom is used to enlarge the text and images on web pages to make them more readable. In most browsers the 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' with '+' will increase zoom. 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' with '-' will reduce zoom and 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' with '0' will reset it.

## Why is Zoom important?

Zoom is used to magnify text and other elements so it becomes readable for people with low vision.

Some people just need to enlarge the text a little if they forgot their reading glasses. Others need to enlarge it a lot, for example up to 200% or even larger.


## Checking Zoom

### Checking this page

This is just for practice. Also, you can see what the check will look like on an accessible page.

* Don't use a big wide browser window. Resize your browser so that it is quite narrow
* Press 'Ctrl'/'Cmd' with '+' to enlarge the text to 200%. Doing it five times should bring you to 200%
* Note that all the text wraps to remain within the visible area as you zoomed
* This page has horizontal text, so no horizontal scrolling is should be required

### Checking other pages 

The same process will work on other pages. However, if the page hasn't been coded with accessibility in mind, the content may become unusable.
   
### What to look for

* All text is still readable
* Text isn't hidden behind other text or images
* If the content uses a horizontal-writing system then check that horizontal scrolling isn't required to view all the content. For content using vertical-writing systems, vertical scrolling shouldn't be required
* Sometimes navigation menus change to an icon that can be clicked to access the menu. This is fine
