## What is Audio Description?

Description of visual information is called _audio description_, _video description_, or _described video_ in different countries.

Audio description explains the visual information needed to understand video content. For example, “Pat opens a small box, looks at a diamond engagement ring, and cries”.

Audio description can be provided as:
- integrated description — description is included in the main speakers' scripts
- alternative video — description is included in a separate video
- separate file — description is in a timed text file or synched audio file that is supported by the media player

For example,

* Integrate:<br>[<img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/media-guide/eg-integrated-description.png" alt="Training video with the description integrated in what the trainer is saying (YouTube)" class="normal video">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfmCvdzqbM)
* Alternative video:<br>[<img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/media-guide/using-description.jpg" alt="Alternative story video with audio description in a different voice (YouTube)" class="normal video">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3A1VffiOH4)

These videos are also available from the W3C website: <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/10/TPAC/w3cx-challenging-assumptions.html#talk" >training video (web page)</a>, <a href="http://media.w3.org/wai/perspective-videos/text-to-speech-ad.mp4">story video (MP4 file size 28MB)</a>.

## Why is Audio Description important?

Audio description is important for people who cannot see the video adequately including people who are blind and some people with low vision.

## Checking Audio Description

1. Check if description is needed. Are there visual elements that are important to understand the video?
2. If it is needed, check if description is provided.
* Is the important visual information included with the main audio? Does the speaker explain the visual information?
* Is a separate described video available? Usually there is a link to a separate described video, or a player control such as <svg role="img" aria-label="Audio Description logo" class="icon-audio-description " data-status="audio-described" style="margin:-0.5em"><use xlink:href="{{ "/assets/images/icons.svg#icon-audio-description" | relative_url }}"></use></svg>.

### Tips

Generally, all text in the video should be included in the main audio or a separate description. For example

* title text at the beginning of the video,
* links and e-mail addresses shown at the end,
* speakers’ names in text, and
* text in a presentation.

The exact text does not have to be included. However, all of the information in the text needs to be available.
