  <p>Note about video description: The video on this page does not include synchronized audio description because the visuals only illustrate the audio and do not provide additional information. In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals.

  <p><strong>Date: </strong>Minor content update 9 August 2023. [<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Easy_Checks_changelog">changelog</a>] Major revision planned for late 2023.<br>
  History: Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility was first published as a draft in June 2013. It replaces Preliminary Review of Web Sites for Accessibility that was first published September 2005 and edited by Shadi Abou-Zahra. It was originally one section of Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility that was first published in October 2001 and edited by Judy Brewer and Chuck Letourneau.</p>

<h2 class="no-display" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>This page helps you start to assess the accessibility of a web page. With these simple steps, you can get an idea whether or not accessibility is addressed in even the most basic way.</strong></p>

<p>These checks cover just a few accessibility issues and are designed to be quick and easy, rather than definitive. A web page could seem to pass these checks, yet still have significant accessibility barriers. More robust assessment is needed to evaluate accessibility comprehensively.</p>

<p>This page provides checks for the following specific aspects of a web page. It also provides guidance on <span class="ptoc"><a href="#next">Next Steps</a></span> and links to more <a href="#evalresources">evaluation resources</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="using"></a>Using these Easy Checks</h2>

<h3 id="excolbuttons">Click headings with [+] buttons to get hidden information</h3>

<p>Some sections of this page might not apply to your situation, for example, they are for a  browser you don't have, or you  only need to read them once. These sections are hidden by default so they don't clutter the page. You can expand them to see the information. The headings of hidden sections have a plus button [+] before them. Screen readers will say something like: &quot;+ Section title, button collapsed&quot;. To get the hidden information, click the button or click anywhere on the heading.</p>

<p>The sections below all have hidden information under expandable headings. The first time you read this page, <strong>we recommend that you expand the headings of these five sections and read them.</strong></p>

{% include excol.html type="start" %}
<h3 id="tools">Tools: WebDev Toolbar and IE WAT <em>(optional)</em></h3>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
<p><strong>You can do most of these checks with any browser, that is, you do <i>not</i> need to download special tools.</strong></p>
<p class="listintro">However, some checks are easier if you can download tools. To keep it simple, we&#39;ve included instructions for just two tools: the Web Developer Toolbar for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (&quot;WebDev Toolbar&quot;) and the Web Accessibility Toolbar for Internet Explorer (&quot;IE WAT&quot;). Both are free extensions/add-ons available in different languages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WebDev Toolbar - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with the WebDev Toolbar&quot;, you&#39;ll need <em>either</em>
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a> and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">Web Developer extension for Chrome</a></li>
      <li>the <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera browser</a> and the <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/web-developer/?display=en-US">Web Developer extension for Opera</a></li>
      <li>the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox browser</a> and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web Developer extension/add-on for Firefox</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>IE WAT - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with IE WAT&quot;, you&#39;ll need the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/Internet-Explorer-11-for-Windows-7-details.aspx">Internet Explorer (IE) browser</a> version 9 or later and the <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/wat/">Web Accessibility Toolbar</a> version  19 July 2013 or later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we&#39;re not endorsing these tools over others. There are many other useful <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools">tools to help with evaluation</a>.</p>
<p><i>(If you can&#39;t download these tools, that&#39;s OK; you can still do the checks indicated &quot;with any browser&quot;.)</i></p>

{% include excol.html type="end" %}{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}

<h3 id="wcaglinks">WCAG links</h3>

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>These checks are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The main points in WCAG are called &quot;Success Criteria&quot;. In the &quot;Learn more from&quot; sections of this page, there are links to pages that explain the relevant success criteria in the &quot;Understanding WCAG&quot; document.</p>

<p><strong>Please see the {% include link.html to="/standards-guidelines/wcag/" text="WCAG Overview" %} for an introduction to WCAG.</strong></p>

{% include excol.html type="end" %}{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}

<h3 id="bad">Practicing with BAD, the Before-After Demo</h3>

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/">Before and After Demonstration (BAD)</a> from W3C WAI shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of this same website with the accessibility barriers fixed. You can use the BAD pages to learn how to do these checks. For example, first, do the check on an accessible version of a page to see what it should look like. Then, do the check on the corresponding inaccessible page to see what it looks like when there are accessibility barriers.</p>
<p>The BAD pages have annotations that are notes on what is accessible and not accessible in the demo pages. To turn on annotations, click &quot;Show Annotations&quot; in the yellow box near the top, middle of the page; then click a number and a box titled <em>&quot;Note ##&quot;</em> will open with the explanation.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>These checks are designed for anyone who can use the web. You don&#39;t need much knowledge or skill. Some of the checks require seeing the web page or hearing the audio. However, there are many things that anyone can check.</p>
<p class="listintro">Here are some things to know that will help you understand the brief explanations throughout this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em><a id="markup"></a>markup</em></strong> refers to web page code, called HTML. You can see the markup of a web page in most browsers by selecting from the menu: View &gt; Source. You do not  need to look at the markup to do these checks; however, it does help to understand what  &quot;markup&quot; and &quot;marked up&quot; means.</li>
  <li><i><a href="{{ "/people-use-web/tools-techniques/" | relative_url }}#at">assistive technologies</a></i> (AT) are software or hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web.</li>
  <li><i><a href="{{ "/people-use-web/tools-techniques/" | relative_url }}#sr">screen readers</a></i> are software that reads aloud the information in web pages and enables keyboard navigation. They are used by people who are blind.</li>
  <li><i><a href="{{ "/people-use-web/tools-techniques/" | relative_url }}#voice">voice input</a></i> is using speech instead of a keyboard and mouse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ctrlcmd">Keyboard instructions: Ctrl for Windows, cmd for Mac</h3>

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>Some of the  keyboard instructions are different for Windows and Mac; for example, &quot;Ctrl&quot; versus &quot;cmd&quot; in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Windows: With the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;.</li>
  <li>For Mac: With the keyboard: cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce clutter, these are listed as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For such instructions, Windows users press the Ctrl key, and Mac users press the cmd key.</p>

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

<h2 id="title">Page title</h2>
<p class="listintro">Page titles are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>shown in the window title bar in some browsers</li>
  <li>shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open</li>
  <li>shown in search engine results</li>
  <li>used for browser bookmarks/favorites</li>
  <li>read by  screen readers</li>
</ul>
<p>(In the web page <a href="#markup" class="termref">markup</a> they are the &lt;title&gt; within the &lt;head&gt;.)</p>
<p>The image below shows the page title &quot;Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility&quot; in the title bar, and the titles of 4 pages in the tabs. Note that in the tabs,  only the first part of the page title is shown.</p>
<figure class="shrink-wrap"> <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}page-title.png" alt="" width="674" height="100"/>
  <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure: Firefox browser with full title  in the title bar and partial titles in the tabs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Good page titles are particularly important for  orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to do:</h3>
<ul class="listwithpul">
  <li>Look at the page&#39;s title (or with a screen reader, listen to it).</li>
  <li>Look at titles of other pages within the website.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<ul class="listwithpul">
  <li>Check that there is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of the page.</li>
  <li>Check that the title is different from other pages on the website, and adequately distinguishes the page from other web pages.</li>
</ul>
{% include excol.html type="start" id="titletips" %}
<h3>Tips</h3>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <ul class="listwithpul listtight">
    <li>There is flexibility on what makes a good page title.</li>
    <li>Best practice is for titles to be &quot;front-loaded&quot; with the important and unique identifying information first.<br />
      For example:
      <ul class="listwithpul">
        <li>Poor titles:
          <ul class="listwithpul">
            <li>Welcome to home page of  Acme Web Solutions, Inc.</li>
            <li>Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us</li>
            <li>Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | Contact Us</li>
            <li>Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | History</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Better page titles:
          <ul class="listwithpul">
            <li>Acme Web Solutions home page</li>
            <li>About Acme Web Solutions</li>

<h3>Page title checks</h3>

<h4 class="f_panelHead listintro">To check page title <em>with different browsers</em></h4>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <ul>
    <li>If you have a  browser that displays the page title in the window title bar by default, use that browser. Some versions of Firefox, Safari, Opera, and older versions of IE show the title by default.
      <ul>
        <li>Firefox on Windows: If the title bar isn't displayed you might be able to display it by pressing: Alt+V, T, M (or right-mouse click in the empty area after the tab and select Menu Bar).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If your browser doesn't have a title bar, you can do try one of these:
      <ul>
        <li>With your mouse, hover over the browser tab to see the full page title, like this:<br />
          <figure class="shrink-wrap">

<h2 id="images">Image text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;)</h2>
<p>Text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;) convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.)</p>
<p>The text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience, not necessarily describe the image. (For example,  appropriate text alternative for a search button <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}search-button.png" alt="" width="36" height="24" /> would be &quot;search&quot;, not &quot;magnifying glass&quot;.)</p>
<p class="listintro">You don&#39;t usually see the alt text on a web page, it is in the web page <a href="#markup" class="termref">markup</a> (like this:<br />
  <code>&lt;img src=&quot;pointer_to_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;here's where the alternative text goes&quot;&gt;</code>).<br />
  Every image should include <code>alt</code> in the markup.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an image conveys information useful for interacting with or understanding the web page content, then it needs alternative text.</li>
  <li>If an image is just decorative and people don&#39;t need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (<code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Automated tests can tell you if <code>alt</code> is missing. To determine if the alternative text is appropriate, you need to see the image and judge it in context.</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<ul class="listwithpul">
  <li>Every image has <code>alt</code> with appropriate alternative text.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>Appropriate alternative text is not an exact science. Some people prefer most images to have more detailed  description; and others prefer much less description.</p>
{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}
<h4 class="f_panelHead listintro">Appropriate alt text:</h4>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <ul class="listspaced">
    <li>The text needs to convey the same meaning as the image. That is, if someone cannot see the image, they get the important information from the image in the alternative text.</li>
    <li>Alternative text depends on context. For example, for an image of a dog on a kennel club website, the alt text might include the breed of the dog; however, the same image on a dog park website may be there just to make the page more attractive, and the image might not need any alt text (and should have null alt). One way to help think about appropriate alt text is: if you were helping someone read and interact with the web page and they cannot see it, what would you say about the image?</li>
    <li>Images that are functional — for example,  images that initiate actions (like submit buttons) and linked images (like in navigation) — need alt text that is the functional equivalent.</li>
    <li>If there is text in the image — for example,  in a logo — that text needs to be included in the alt text.</li>
    <li>If the image has complex information  — such as charts or graphs — the image should have a short alt text to identify the image, and then the detailed description of the information should be provided elsewhere (for example, in a data table).</li>
  </ul>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}
{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}
<h4 class="f_panelHead listintro">What is not needed in the alt text:</h4>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <ul class="listspaced">
    <li>If the image is not important for understanding the content — for example, it is just decoration or &quot;eye candy&quot; — it should have null alt (<code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code>). One way to help determine if an image should have null alt is to ask yourself: <em>If the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page?</em></li>
    <li>The alternative text does not need to include the words &quot;button&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, or &quot;image of&quot;. (Screen readers automatically provide that information.)</li>
    <li>If the image is sufficiently described in the text — for example, a simple diagram illustrating what&#39;s written in the web page text — it can have brief alt text such as &quot;Diagram of work flow as describe above.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}
{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}
<h4 class="f_panelHead listintro"><code>alt</code> attribute in HTML (not &quot;alt tag&quot;)</h4>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <p>In HTML (which is web page code, called <a href="#markup" class="termref">markup</a>), alt is an attribute of the image element, and other elements. (So &quot;alt tag&quot; is technically incorrect; the correct terminology is &quot;alt attribute&quot;, or you can say &quot;alt text&quot;.) It looks like this in markup: <code>&lt;img alt=&quot;WAI logo&quot; src=&quot;/wai/logo.png&quot;&gt;</code></p>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}
<h3>Alt text checks</h3>
<p>There are three options to check alt text listed below. The first one is the easiest, if you have the IE WAT toolbar. If you don&#39;t have any toolbars, there is a check at the end for any browser.</p>
{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}
<h4>To check alt text <em>with IE WAT</em></h4>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <ol>
    <li>Open the web page you are checking.</li>
    <li>In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Show Images&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+4, then arrow down to &quot;Show Images&quot;<br />

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>
<p>Web pages often have sections of information separated by visual headings, for example, heading text is bigger and bold (like &quot;Headings&quot; right above this sentence :-). To make these work for everyone, the headings need to be <a href="#markup" class="termref">marked up</a>. That way people can navigate to the headings — including people who cannot use a mouse and use only the keyboard, and people who use a screen reader.</p>
<p class="listintro">Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy, e.g.: </p>
<ul class="listafterpul listtight">
  <li>Heading Level 1 &lt;h1&gt;
    <ul>
      <li>Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt;
        <ul>
          <li>Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt;</li>
          <li>Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt;
        <ul>
          <li>Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt;
            <ul>
              <li>Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt;</li>
              <li>Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="whathead" id="headingswhattocheck">What to check for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The page has a heading. In almost all pages there should be at least one heading.</li>
  <li>All text that looks like a heading is marked up as a heading.</li>
  <li>All text that is marked up as a heading is really a conceptual section heading.</li>
  <li>The heading  hierarchy is meaningful. Ideally the page starts with an &quot;h1&quot; — which is usually similar to the page title — and does not skip levels; however, these are not absolute requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headings checks</h3>
<p class="listintro">The checks below provide instructions with different browsers for how to get an outline from headings or headings markup in a page.</p>
<p>Headings outline: an outline of the headings that are marked up on page, for example:</p>

<h2 id="contrast"> Contrast ratio (&quot;color contrast&quot;)</h2>

  <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure: Gray text on light background. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>High contrast (for example, dark text on light background or bright text on dark background) is required by some people with visual impairments, including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from ageing.</p>
<figure class="shrink-wrap">

<p>While some people need high contrast, for others &mdash; including some people with  reading disabilities such as dyslexia &mdash;  bright colors (high luminance) are not readable. They need low luminance.</p>

<p>Web browsers should allow people to change the color of text and background, and web pages need to work when people change colors.</p>
<p>(This accessibility requirement is sometimes called sufficient &quot;color contrast&quot;; however,  that is incorrect &mdash; technically it's &quot;luminance contrast&quot;. On this page we use &quot;contrast ratio&quot; as short for &quot;luminance contrast ratio&quot; because it's less jargony.) There is much more to know about contrast; we&#39;ve just introduced the basics here.</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<p>Web pages should also have a minimum contrast by default: a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal-size text.</p>
<p class="listintro">There are basically three ways to check  contrast, each with strengths and weaknesses. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Table with contrast ratio</strong> - The tool displays a table with all the possible contrast ratios in the web page. With some tools, you can click in the table and it will show where that color combination is in the web page.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Pro: </em>Comprehensive.</li>
      <li><em>Con: </em>Can be inaccurate, specifically, it can show some color combinations that are not really in the displayed page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Eye-dropper to select colors</strong> - The tool lets you select a text color and a background color, then it shows you the contrast ratio.<br />
    <ul>
      <li><em>Pro: </em>Accurate.</li>
      <li><em>Con: </em>Can only test one item at a time. Need to be able to see and use a mouse.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Turn off color.</strong> The tool shows the page in grayscale.
    <ul>

        <li><em>In the bottom of the Color Contrast Analyser window, the resulting luminosity Contrast ratio will show (for example: 7.5:1), along with &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot; and a visual example of the colors.</em></li>

<h2 id="resize">Resize text</h2>
<p>Some people need to enlarge web content in order to read it. Some  need to change other aspects of text display: font, space between lines, and more.</p>
<p class="listintro">Most browsers allow users to change text size through:</p>
<ul>
  <li> text size settings (usually through Options or Preferences)</li>
  <li>text-only  zoom</li>
  <li>page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>When pages are not designed properly, they  can be unusable when the text size is changed, especially when it is changed through  text-only zoom or text settings. Sometimes columns and sections overlap, the space between lines disappears,  lines of text become too long, or text disappears.</p>
<figure class="shrink-wrap">
  <div class="figcontent"><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}zoom-100.png" alt="" width="305" height="224" /><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}zoom-overlap.png" alt="" width="305" height="224" /></div>
  <figcaption>Figure: Two screen captures show that when text size is increased, the heading overlaps the main text, the main text overlaps the sidebar text; and the sidebar text is cut off at the bottom.</figcaption>
</figure>
<!--figure-->

<p>When text size is increased, sometimes part of the sentences are not visible  and users have to scroll horizontally to read a sentence, as shown in the third example below. Most people cannot effectively read text that requires horizontal scrolling, and some disabilities make this impossible.</p>

</figure>
<!--figure-->
<h3 class="whathead">What to do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Increase the text size.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> All text  gets larger. (A common problem is that text is not provided as actual text format but instead the text is in an image. Text in images does not get larger when users increase text size.)</li>
  <li>Text doesn't disappear or get cut off.</li>
  <li>Text, images, and other content do not overlap.</li>
  <li>All buttons, form fields, and other controls are visible and usable.</li>
  <li>Horizontal scrolling is not required to read sentences or &quot;blocks of text&quot;. It is best practice that when text size is increased, all the text in a sentence is visible. It is acceptable to have to scroll horizontally to get to different sections of a page. <em>(For top-to-bottom languages, change &quot;horizontal scrolling&quot; to &quot;vertical scrolling&quot;.)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions below are for text-only zoom. You can also change the text size settings, for example, through Tools &gt; Options or Preferences. To keep this simple, we don't include instructions for changing those settings. We also don't include instructions for page zoom because it does not usually reveal the accessibility barriers described above.</p>
<p>For Chrome, you need an extention to get text-only zoom. Instructions for Firefox, Safari, and IE are below.</p>

<h2 id="interaction">Keyboard access and visual focus</h2>
<p>Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. People who are blind and some sighted people with mobility impairments  rely on the keyboard or on assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people to access all content and functionality &mdash; links, forms, media controls, etc. &mdash; through a keyboard.</p>
<p>Keyboard focus should be visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a  border or highlight, as shown below, that moves as  you tab through the web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Mac browsers, enable keyboard navigation to all controls.
    <ul>
      <li>In newer browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts. Select the &quot;All controls&quot; option button.</li>
      <li>In older browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. In the &quot;Full Keyboard Access&quot; section, check &quot;All Controls&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>(In Windows browsers, you don't need to do this step.)</em>
  </li>
  <li>Click in the address bar, then put your mouse aside and <b>do not use it</b>.</li>
  <li>Press the 'Tab' key to move through the elements on the page. You can press 'Shift-Tab' to go backwards.</li>
  <li>To move within elements such as drop-down lists and menu bars, press the arrow keys.</li>
  <li>To select a specific item within a drop-down list:
    <ul>
      <li>Tab to the list box,</li>
      <li>use the arrow keys to move the focus to items,</li>
      <li>when an item has focus,  press the Enter key or Space bar to select that item.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<ul class="listspaced">
  <li><strong>Tab to all:</strong> Check that you can  tab to all the elements, including links, form fields, buttons, and media player controls. (A common problem is that you cannot tab to media player controls.)</li>
  <li><strong>Tab away:</strong> Check that you can  tab <strong>away</strong> from all elements that you can tab into.  (A common problem is the keyboard focus gets caught in media controls and you cannot get out; it's called the &quot;keyboard trap&quot;.)</li>
  <li><strong>Tab order: </strong>Check that the  tab order follows the logical reading order (e.g., for left-to-right languages: top to bottom, left to right) in sequence.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual focus: </strong>Check that the focus  is clearly visible as you tab through the elements, that is, you can tell which element has focus, e.g., links have a gray outline around them or are  highlighted.</li>
  <li><strong>All functionality by keyboard: </strong>Check that you can do everything with  the keyboard; that is, you don't need the mouse to activate actions, options, visible changes, and other <a href="/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality" class="termref">functionality</a>. (A common problem is that some functionality is   available only with mouse hover, and is not available with keyboard focus.)</li>
  <li><strong><a id="dropdown"></a>Drop-down lists: </strong>Check that after you  tab into a drop-down list, you can  use the arrow keys to move through all the options without triggering an action. (A common problem for drop-downs used for navigation is that as soon as you arrow down, it automatically selects the first item in the list and goes to a new page &mdash; you cannot get to other items in the list.)</li>
  <li><strong>Image links: </strong>Check that when images  are links, they have clear visual focus and  can be  activated using the keyboard (usually by pressing the Enter key).</li>

<h2 id="forms">Forms, labels, and errors</h2>
<p><em>Note: This section is more complex than the others. If it's too complicated, consider skipping it for now and proceeding through the remaining checks</em>.</p>
<p>Labels, keyboard access, clear instructions, and effective error handling are  important for forms accessibility.</p>
<p>Form fields and other form controls usually have visible labels, such as &quot;E-mail Address:&quot; as the label for a text field.<br />
  <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}form-label-text.png" width="242" height="29" alt="" class="imgbreathe"/><br />
  When these labels are <a href="#markup" class="termref">marked up</a> correctly,  people can interact with them using  only the keyboard, using voice input, and using screen readers. Also, the label itself becomes clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons or checkboxes.</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to do:</h3>
<p class="whathead">Find  any forms on the page. A form could be a single text box, such as Search, or could be a complex form with text  fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and  buttons.</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<h4 class="small4">Keyboard access</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Check that all form controls are keyboard accessible by following the <a href="#interaction">keyboard access</a> checks above, including checking that you can get to all items in any <a href="#dropdown">drop-down lists</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="small4">Labels</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check that every form control has a label associated with it <span class="listintro"> using 'label', 'for', and 'id'</span>, as shown in the <a href="#labelschecks">labels checks</a> below. (This is best practice in most cases, though not a requirement because a form control label can be associated in other ways.)</li>
  <li>Check that the labels are positioned correctly. For left-to-right languages, labels should usually be:
    <ul>
      <li>Left of text boxes and drop-down lists.<br />
        <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}form-label-text.png" width="242" height="29" alt="" class="imgbreathe"/></li>
      <li>Right of radio buttons and checkboxes. <br/>
        <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}form-label-radio.png" alt="" width="216" height="64" class="imgbreathe"/> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="small4">Required fields and other instructions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check that any fields that are required/mandatory are clearly indicated.
    <ul>
      <li>Check that the indicator does not rely on color alone, for example, if required fields were only indicated by red colored labels, they would not be accessible to people who do not see the different colors.</li>
      <li>Check that the indicator (such as asterisks (*)) is included in the marked up field label for text boxes and drop-down lists, or legend for  radio buttons and checkboxes, as shown in the <a href="#labelschecks">labels checks</a> below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check that any instructions for completing the form are before they are needed, for example,
    <ul>
      <li>General instructions should usually be at the top of the form or the section they relate to.</li>
      <li>Check that required formats, such as dates (year-month-date in the format 0000-00-00), are included in the marked up label, using the <a href="#labelschecks">labels checks</a> below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="small4 listintro">Error handling</h4>
<p class="listintro spacenotop">Some simple forms, such as a single search field, might not have any errors. If you think the form(s) on the page you are checking might have error messages, try leaving required fields blank or entering incorrectly-formatted information (such as telephone number or e-mail address), then submitting the form. If you get errors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that clear and specific guidance is provided to help people understand and fix the error. If the error concerns a format such as date, time, or address, check that the  correct format is clearly explained.</li>
  <li>Check that the errors are easily findable. Generally it is best if the error messages are before the form, rather than after the form.</li>
  <li>Check that the fields without errors are still populated with the data you entered. (This is best practice, though not a requirement.) People should not have to re-enter all the information in the form, except for some sensitive data such as credit card numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labelschecks">Labels checks</h3>
<p><span class="listintro"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> These instructions help you check  if labels are <a href="#markup" class="termref">marked up</a> with 'label', 'for', and 'id'; they do <strong>not</strong> check if  form controls are identified in other ways.</span> Therefore, even if a form does not pass these checks, it might still meet WCAG.</p>

<h2 id="moving">Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content</h2>
<p>Moving, flashing, or blinking content includes carousels (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/animations/#c">example carousel</a>), ads, videos, auto-updating stock tickers, scrolling news feeds, and more. Users need to be able to control moving content, especially some people with attention deficit disorder or visual processing disorders.</p>
<p>Potential accessibility problems with moving, flashing, or blinking content include:</p>
<ol class="listspaced">
  <li>Understanding moving information — Some people read and process information slowly. The content may disappear before people have time to read it. Some people have difficulty tracking moving objects.</li>
  <li>Distraction from moving content — Moving content can make focusing and reading elsewhere difficult; that is, people cannot focus on some content because the movement in another area of the web page grabs their attention.</li>
</ol>
<p class="listintro">Additionally,  flashing or blinking content can cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy, particularly if it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>flashes more than three times in one second,</li>
  <li>covers a large enough area of the screen, and</li>
  <li>is bright enough.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check if there is any <strong>moving, blinking, or scrolling information</strong> that starts automatically and lasts more than five seconds. If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the movement.</li>
  <li>Check if there is any <strong>auto-updated information</strong> (such as stock price). If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the updated information, or for the user to control the frequency of the update.</li>
  <li>Check that <strong>no content flashes or blinks</strong> more than three times in one second. If it does, further evaluation is needed as explained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold">Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a>.</li>

<h2 id="media">Multimedia (video, audio) alternatives</h2>
<p>Information in podcasts or other audio is not available to people who are deaf or some people who are hard of hearing, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as captions and text  transcripts. Visual information in videos is not available to people who are blind or some people what have low vision, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as audio or  text. (Text can be read  by a screen reader or Braille display, or enlarged and reformatted for people with low vision.)</p>
<p> (Remember these easy checks  are not comprehensive or definitive.)</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<h4>Keyboard access</h4>
<p>Follow the steps above for <a href="#interaction">keyboard access</a> to ensure that the media player controls are labeled and keyboard accessible.</p>
<h4>Auto-start control</h4>
<p class="listintro">It is best if audio (including background noise and video with sound) does not start automatically when a web page opens. If it does start automatically, it should either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stop after 3 seconds.</li>
  <li>Include controls to pause or stop the audio.</li>
  <li>Include controls to turn down the volume.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Captions</h4>
<p>(Captions are known as &quot;subtitles&quot; in some areas.)</p>
<p>Most video on the web that provides captions has &quot;closed captions&quot; that can be turned on and off. (&quot;Open captions&quot; are always shown.) For example, in YouTube, you turn on captions with the CC button <img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}cc-button.png" alt="" width="26" height="21" /> (no known keyboard access). If there is not a CC button, there are no captions available for that video.</p>
<p>Automatic captions are not sufficient for accessibility because they are not accurate enough. For example, in YouTube, if only &quot;automatic captions&quot; are listed<!-- TODO Low Priority Add Image (as in the image above) -->, there are no sufficient captions and the video is not accessible. Captions in the specific language need to be listed.<!-- [@@ say more ?] --></p>
<figure class="shrink-wrap">
  <div class="figcontent"><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}captions-both.png" alt="" width="231" height="173" /></div>
  <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure: Captions listed: French (automatic captions), Norwegian.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="listintro">If there are captions, you can check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The captions seem in sync with the spoken content.</li>
  <li>The people who are speaking are identified when they speak.</li>
  <li>Important sound other than dialogue  &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking &mdash; is included.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>It is best practice to provide both  captions and transcripts, although  not always required; <a href="http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcripts_on_the_web.html#benes">providing transcripts has many benefits</a> &mdash; both to people with disabilities and to website owners.</p>
<p class="listintro">Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio/video itself and any links to the audio/video.</p>
<p class="listintro">Check that  transcripts include all audio information, including dialogue with  the speakers  identified, and all important sound  &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking.</p>
<p>A transcript for a video could provide all the audio and all the visual information, so that a person can get all the content of the video by reading the text.</p>
<h4>Audio description</h4>
<p>Audio description (sometimes known as described video, video description, or visual interpretation) is description of important visual information in a video, in order to make it accessible to people who cannot see. For example, some videos start out with a title in text, have speaker names  in text, and have illustrations. That visual information  needs to be provided to people who cannot see the video. It can be provided through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audio description - where the audio track includes someone describing the important visuals. Audio description can be included in the main video, or it can be provided in a separate video.</li>
  <li>Text transcript - that includes description of meaningful visual information (so it's kind of like  a screenplay).</li>

<h2 id="structure">Basic structure check</h2>
<p><em>While the other checks on this page focus on specific success criteria in WCAG, this check is more broad. It helps you understand how some people &quot;see&quot; the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout.</em></p>
<p>Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual  aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. However, some people do not see the page this way. People who are blind listen to the page with a screen reader or read it from a Braille display. Some people  with low vision and others change the way the page is displayed so they can read it; for example, change from multiple columns to one column, change the text size, and more.</p>
<p>An important issue is how the web page works when it is &quot;linearized&quot; into one column and the presentation is changed, as shown in the images below.</p>
{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}
<p id="limgs"><strong>Images showing linearized and changed display </strong><em>(click to show images)</em></p>
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
  <p>The images below illustrate how a web page is displayed in 3 columns by default and how it can be changed.</p>
  <p class="listintro">Figure A shows the default display of three columns, with the navigation at the left.</p>
  <figure class="shrink-wrap">
    <div class="figcontent"><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}lin-start.png" alt="" width="363" height="150"/></div>
    <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure A.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Figure B shows the page linearized into one column, with the navigation at the top. Figure C shows the page  linearized, with the navigation at the bottom. The order of the sections (e.g., navigation at top or bottom or elsewhere) depends on how the web page is developed &mdash; the user usually cannot control the order.</p>
  <div class="multifigs">
    <figure class="shrink-wrap">
      <div class="figcontent"><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}lin-lin.png" alt="" width="359" height="278"/></div>

    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>Figure D shows the page linearized and with styles turned off. When you follow the <a href="#bschecks">Basic structure checks steps below</a>, your page will look like something like this:</p>

    <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure D.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Figure E shows the page changed by a person with low vision to make it more readable, for example, the main text is big, the footer text is very small, and the headings are a different color.</p>
  <figure class="shrink-wrap">
    <div class="figcontent"><img src="{{ "/content-images/easy-checks/archive/" | relative_url }}lin-lv.png" alt="" width="359" height="429" /></div>

<p>While it is useful to have an experienced screen reader user check web pages, anyone can get an initial idea of  potential accessibility barriers for screen reader users and others who change the way the page is presented. The steps below show you how to disable images, disable styles for how the page is usually displayed, and linearize the page to check the page structure.</p>
<p id="dtnote">Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data tables will not make sense when linearized &mdash; that's OK because  screen readers have functionality to make data tables usable (when they are marked up correctly).</li>
  <li>BAD provides a clear example of how the basic structure check reveals accessibility barriers. (It's also a bit funny, and we suggest you check it out, by following the <a href="#plainBAD">BAD instructions</a> below.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to do:</h3>
<p class="listintro">Get a basic structure view of the page by following the instructions under <a href="#bschecks">Basic structure checks</a> below to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Turn off images and show the text alternatives.</li>
  <li>Turn off style sheets (CSS), which specifies how the page is displayed with layout, colors, etc.</li>
  <li>Linearize the page or the tables (depending on the toolbar).</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to check for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check that the information makes sense when read in the order it is shown; for example, headings are right above the information they apply to.<br />
    <em>(Data tables do not need to make sense linearized, per the <a href="#dtnote">note</a> above.)</em></li>
  <li>Check that the alternative text provides adequate information for the missing images (per the <a href="#images">Image text alternatives</a> section above).</li>
  <li>Check that blocks of information have clear headings (see also the <a href="#headings">Headings</a> section above). When navigation, main content, and other sections have  good headings, it's easier for people to find their way around the information.</li>
