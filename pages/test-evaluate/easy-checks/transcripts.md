## What are Transcripts?

**Basic transcripts** are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the multimedia content. They are similar to captions, but in a format that can be easily opened and read.

**Descriptive transcripts** for videos also include visual information needed to understand the content.

For videos with visual and audio information, ideally a descriptive transcript is provided, and a separate basic transcript is not needed.

### Examples

Example part of transcript of a podcast interview with two speakers

{% include box.html type="start" class="simple" %}

<p><strong>Rajwinder Kaur</strong>: Welcome to the podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn Lawton Henry:</strong>: Thank you for this opportunity to share information about accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Would you start by telling us a little about your role at W3C?</p>
<p><strong>Shawn</strong>: I work within the Web Accessibility Initiative, W-A-I, pronounced "way". </p>

## Why are Transcripts important?

Transcripts are important for people who are deafblind to understand a video. Screen reader users may also prefer the transcript over listening to the audio of the video.

## Checking Transcripts

* Check for a transcript with the media or a link to a transcript.
* Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio or video.
* If the video has important visual content, check that it is described in the transcript.

### Check transcript quality

* Is all the speech accurately reflected in the transcript?
* Are all the speakers identified?
* Are all other sounds described in the transcript, such as 'soft clapping' or 'tires screeching'?
* Is all visual content important to understanding the video described in the transcript?
