## Test & Evaluate

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

_For videos introducing the evaluation resources below, go to [[Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview]](/test-evaluate/)._

When developing or redesigning a website or web application, evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them.

There are evaluation tools that help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility standards. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible.

### Initial Checks {#initial}

{% include video-card.html
  video-url="//media.w3.org/wai/evaluation-intros/easy-checks-accessibility.mp4"
  captions="/wai-videos/evaluating/easy-checks-accessibility.en.vtt|en|default"

  accessible-version-label="Video: Easy Checks Overview"
  poster="/content-images/test-eval/video-thumb-easy-checks.png"
%}

Even if you don’t know anything about accessibility and you don’t have a robust accessibility tool, you can check some aspects of accessibility.

[[Easy Checks — A First Review of Web Accessibility]](/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
:   Provides step-by-step guidance and brief explanations for checking some aspects of accessibility.

### Tools

:   Helps you generate evaluation reports according to WCAG-EM. It does not do the checking for you. It helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and it generates a report from the input you provide.

[[Template for Web Accessibility Evaluation Reports]](/test-evaluate/report-template/)
:   Suggests information to include in a report.

[ATAG Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/)
:   Helps you generate a report on how a tool meets Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines ([ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)). Authoring tools are software and services used to create web content – such as content management systems (CMS) and what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors.

[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/)
:  Describe how to test conformance of accessibility standards such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA. ACT Rules are primarily used by developers of test tools and methodologies. Accessibility testers may find some rules helpful for evaluating edge cases consistently.

Specifications for expressing test results (EARL) and for writing accessibility test rules (Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format) are introduced in [[Evaluation Standards Overview – ACT & EARL]](/standards-guidelines/evaluation/).

### People

## Standards/Guidelines

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops international Web standards: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and many more. W3C's Web standards are called <dfn>W3C Recommendations</dfn>.

All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA](/about/groups/apawg/)) Working Group.

The W3C standards and Working Group Notes introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility.

### Accessibility Guidelines {#guidelines}

[[Essential Components of Web Accessibility]](/fundamentals/components/) shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, and how the WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) apply.

#### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 {#wcag}

Web "content" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:

* natural information such as text, images, and sounds
* code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.

WCAG 2 applies to dynamic content, multimedia, "mobile", etc. WCAG can also be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), as described in [WCAG2ICT](/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/).

WCAG 2 info:

WCAG 3 info:
- [[WCAG 3 Introduction]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/)

#### Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) {#atag}

Authoring tools are software and services that "authors" (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. For example: HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), and websites that let users add content, such as blogs and social networking sites. ATAG documents explain how to:
* make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and
* help authors create more accessible web content.

ATAG info:
- [ATAG Overview](/standards-guidelines/atag/)
- [[ATAG at a Glance]](/standards-guidelines/atag/glance/)
- [ATAG 2.0 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG/)
- [ATAG Report Tool](/atag/report-tool/)

#### User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) {#uaag}

User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers, and other applications that render web content.

UAAG info:
- [[UAAG Overview]](/standards-guidelines/uaag/)
- [UAAG 2.0 Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/)

### Technical Specifications

#### Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) {#aria}

ARIA provides semantics so authors can convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). The ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements.

The ARIA suite includes <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> mapping specifications that provide user agent implementation guidance. It also include modules for Graphics and Digital Publishing.

ARIA info:
- [[WAI-ARIA Overview]](/standards-guidelines/aria/) – includes a [list and description of modules and API mappings](/standards-guidelines/aria/#versions)
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/)
- [WAI-ARIA 1.2 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)

#### Audio and Video {#multimedia}

- [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/) is a format for captions, text video descriptions, and other metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.

- [Timed Text Markup Language (TTML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/) is intended to be used for transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats for subtitling and captioning.

#### Evaluation {#eval}

The following resources support development of accessibility evaluation methods and tools:

- [[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Overview]](/standards-guidelines/act/) &mdash; ACT establishes and documents rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards. The [WCAG 2 Test Rules](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) use the ACT rules format.

- [[Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview]](/standards-guidelines/earl/) &mdash; EARL is a machine-readable format for expressing test results.

Additional resources related to evaluation are listed in the [[Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview]](/test-evaluate/), including:

- [[WCAG-EM Overview: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology]](/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/) &mdash; WCAG-EM is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

#### WAI-Adapt

[[WAI-Adapt Overview]](/adapt/) &mdash; WAI-Adapt enables users to adapt (or ‘personalize’) how content is presented to meet their needs and preferences. Content authors can use WAI-Adapt standards to provide a default design and enable user adaptation with minimal work.

#### Pronunciation

[[Pronunciation Overview]](/pronunciation/) &mdash; Pronunciation is about screen readers and other text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis pronouncing content properly.
