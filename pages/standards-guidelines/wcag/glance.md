## Versions

This page has summaries at the guideline level. The guidelines are the same in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2. To learn about the new success criteria, see [[What's New in WCAG 2.2]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).

[[WCAG 2.0 at a Glance]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/20/glance/) has two differences from above:
* "Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions." does not include "or physical reactions".
* It does not include "Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard."
