## Introduction

For an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and more about versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, see the [WCAG Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

WCAG 2.1 provides 17 additional success criteria to address:

- [mobile accessibility](/standards-guidelines/mobile/)
- people with low vision
- [people with cognitive and learning disabilities](/cognitive/)

## Guideline 1.3 Adaptable

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

### 1.3.4 Orientation (AA)

<blockquote class="sc">
  <p>Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential" data-link-type="dfn">essential</a>.</p>

## About the Personas Quotes

The linked persona roles go to the [Stories of Web Users](/people-use-web/user-stories/archived/). That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future.

After we’ve reviewed these persona quotes sufficiently, we plan to add
them to the Understanding documents.
