This page describes many of the barriers that people with disabilities
and people using mobile devices experience when interacting with web
content, including web applications. It shows how these **barriers are
similarly addressed in [W3C](http://www.w3.org/)'s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Mobile Web Best Practices, and Mobile
Web Application Best Practices.**

## Background

People with disabilities using computers have similar interaction
limitations as people without disabilities who are using mobile devices.
Both experience similar barriers when interacting with websites and web
applications. There is also significant overlap between the design
solutions for both. For more background, see:

-   An introduction to the overlap between W3C guidelines for
    accessibility and best practices for mobile devices: [Web Content
    Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Website Accessible Both for
    People with Disabilities and for Mobile
    Devices](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap)
-   [Introduction to Web
    Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php)
-   [How People with Disabilities Use the
    Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web.php)

A comprehensive comparison between MWBP and WCAG is provided in
[Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/).

## Introduction

The barriers on this page are grouped under four principles:
perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. These principles lay
the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use web content, as
described in [Understanding the Four Principles of
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head)
section of Introduction to Understanding WCAG 2.0. (Mobile devices vary
widely and not all the barriers are present on all models.)

This page includes links to some relevant solutions in:

-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/) ***Note:* [W3C WAI recommends
    using WCAG 2.0]({{ "/standards-guidelines/wcag/" | relative_url }}#version), instead
    of WCAG 1.0.**
-   [Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/)

## Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users
in ways they can perceive.

Experiences discussed below are also available in [tabular
format](experiences-table.html#perceivable_section).

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Information conveyed solely with color" id="color" class="large" h="3" %}
{:/}

User perceives color incorrectly or not at all, and so misses or
misunderstands information or makes mistakes.

**Disabilities Context:** User who is blind or colorblind perceives
color incorrectly or not at all.

-   WCAG 2.0 success criteria: [1.4.1 Use of
    Color](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-without-color),

    and
-    [2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-color-contrast).
{:.inline.wcag1}

**Mobile Context:** Many screens have limited color palette and color
difference is not presented. Device is used in poor lighting (for
example, outdoors), so colors are not clearly perceived.

-   MWBP 1.0 Best Practice:
    [USE\_OF\_COLOR](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#USE_OF_COLOR) and

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Large pages or large images" id="image" class="large" h="3" %}
{:/}

User only sees small areas at a time, is unable to relate different
areas of a page, and so becomes disoriented or has to scroll
excessively. Additionally, user cannot access picture details because
the picture is shrunk.

**Disabilities Context:** User with restricted field of vision or using
screen magnifier gets only small part of page or image at a time.

    and
-    [1.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10#tech-synchronize-equivalents).
{:.inline.wcag1}

**Mobile Context:** Mobile users often turn off sound in public places
(trains, hotel lobbies); or often cannot hear in noisy places (streets,
nightclubs).

-   MWBP 1.0 Best Practice:
    [NON-TEXT-ALTERNATIVES](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES).

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Audio-only prompts (beeps) for important information (warnings, errors)" id="prompts" class="large" h="3" %}

{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Non-text objects (images, sound, video) with no text alternative" id="non-text" class="large" h="3" %}
{:/}

User cannot perceive important information or loses information due to
lack of alternative.

**Disabilities Context:** User who is blind cannot perceive content that
include non-text objects. Furthermore, information not available to user
whose browser, assistive technology, other user agent doesn't support
object.

-   WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria: [1.1.1 Non-text
    content](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-equiv-all).
{:.inline}

-   WCAG 1.0 checkpoint:
    [1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tech-text-equivalent).
{:.inline.wcag1}

**Mobile Context:** User can be billed for download volume so images
might be turned off to save costs. Some mobile user agents have limited
support for non-text objects so user loses information. Some user agents
also shrunk images in size to fit the device's screen which can make
images meaningless.

-   MWBP 1.0 Best Practice:
    [NON\_TEXT\_ALTERNATIVES](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES)

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Missing or inappropriate page title" id="title" class="large" h="3" %}
{:/}

User cannot easily scan to get an overview because of missing,
inappropriate, or long page title.

**Disabilities Context:** User who is blind typically uses a screen
reader feature to get a list of the currently open windows, by window
title. Therefore, if the page title is long, inappropriate or missing,
user cannot perceive the content.

Robust
------

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a
wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

Experiences discussed below are also available in [tabular
format](experiences-table.html#robust_section).

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Invalid or unsupported markup" id="markup" class="large" h="3" %}
{:/}

User cannot access the content because browser or adaptation system
chokes on markup or rejects or garbles it.

**Disabilities Context:** User's assistive technology or browser cannot
handle markup.
