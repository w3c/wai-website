To get caught up, read: **[What We're Working On &mdash; Accessibility Activities and Publications](/update/)**.

You can get announcements of new WAI publications, draft documents for review, and other news from:

- **[W3C_WAI on Mastodon {% include_cached external.html %}](https://w3c.social/@wai)**
- **[W3C-WAI on LinkedIn {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.linkedin.com/company/w3c-wai/)**
- **WAI Announcement e-mail list** - Official announcements from WAI. We only send a few messages per month to this list, to avoid clutter.

  - To unsubscribe, send e-mail to [public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo;](mailto:public-wai-announce-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe).

- WAI IG Discussion e-mail list - All announcements sent to the WAI Announcement list will also be sent to the WAI IG list, so you don't need to subscribe to both lists. The WAI IG list is open to the public for discussing web accessibility issues. For information on subscribing and posting messages, see [WAI IG Mailing List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/#mailinglist).
- **[Atom/RSS feed](/WAI/feed.xml)** has the last 10 announcements.
