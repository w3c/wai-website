What is "Large Links, Buttons, and Controls"? {#what}
---------------------------------------------

The area for clicking and tapping controls must be large enough for
people to activate them. This includes links, buttons, checkboxes, and
other controls. Small controls, and controls that are placed too close
to each other, are difficult for many people to use. This is
particularly relevant on mobile devices with small screens.

Who depends on this feature? {#who}
----------------------------

-   People with physical disabilities who have reduced dexterity.

What are the additional benefits? {#others}
---------------------------------

-   Content is more usable on touch screens, especially on smaller
    mobile devices.
-   Content is more usable for people who are not experienced with the
    mouse or touch-pad on the computer they are using.
-   Content is more usable in situations where the device cannot be held
    steady.

What needs to happen for this to work? {#action}
--------------------------------------

Design large controls or activation areas around the controls.
(Increasing the font size of the control sometimes isn't enough.)
Provide adequate separation between selectable controls. Provide labels
for controls, which enlarges the activation area in many browsers
because the label for checkboxes and option buttons is also clickable.
