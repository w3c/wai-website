## What is "Colors with Good Contrast"?
{:#what}

Colors must have sufficient contrast between text color and its background (technically called <em>luminosity contrast ratio</em>). This includes text on images, icons, and buttons. Also colors used to convey information on diagrams, maps, and other types of images must be distinguishable.

## Who depends on this feature?
{:#who}

-   People with low contrast sensitivity, which is common in older
    people.
-   People with color blindness who cannot distinguish between certain
    colors.

## What are the additional benefits?
{:#others}

-   Content works in different lighting conditions, such as sunlight and
    glare.
-   Content is easier to read by everyone, including those who do not
    have specific visual conditions.

## What needs to happen for this to work?
{:#action}

Select text and background colors that provide sufficient contrast.
There are tools to help check and select appropriate color combinations.
This is ideally done during the early design stage and the selection of
color palettes. While some people need high contrast, some people are
sensitive to brightness and need to [change the colors]({{ site.github.url }}{% link _perspective-videos/customizable.md %}).
